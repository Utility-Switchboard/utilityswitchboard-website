While it can be difficult to find the right numbers to get through to the right people, we’ve brought together all the ways you can contact EE with all your TV and broadband questions.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about my bills</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll get your first broadband bill within 4 days of your broadband going live and all bills will be available through your My EE account on the same day every month.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to talk to someone about your broadband bills, there are a range of numbers you can use to contact EE:</p>\n<ul><li>150 from an EE mobile</li>\n<li>0800 079 8586 from an EE landline (which comes with EE broadband)</li>\n<li>07953 966 250 from a non-EE phone</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can also text BILL to 150 to view your recent bills and payments.</p>\n\n<h3>Paying your broadband bills</h3>\n\n<p>The easiest way to pay your broadband bill is by setting up a direct debit. You’ll pay your bill in advance every month and is usually taken 10 days after you get your bill.</p>\n\n<center><a href='https://id.ee.co.uk/id/login' target=\"_blank\" class='curve-btn-main btn-white' rel=\"noopener\">Set up a direct debit</a></center>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can pay by <a href=\"https://id.ee.co.uk/id/login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debit or credit card</a>, or by calling 0800 028 0543.</p>\n\n<p>If your bill is 14 days overdue and you don’t have a payment card registered to your account, you’ll get a text from EE (it will ONLY ever come from +44 7860 035968). You’ll be given the option to pay by text, which you can do by replying ‘YES’ and following the instructions. If you don’t reply within 5 days, your service may be shut off.</p>\n\n<h3>What to do if you’re having trouble paying</h3>\n\n<p>If you don’t think you’ll be able to pay your broadband bill, the first thing you should do is contact the EE customer service team on 0800 079 8586. They can give you support while you’re struggling and help make your payments more manageable.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t contact EE in this situation, your service might be suspended and you won’t be able to use your broadband until you pay your unpaid bills. EE may also add a termination fee to your account and pass your details to a debt collection company that may add their own extra fees.</p>\n\n<p>If your direct debit has failed, EE will attempt to collect the payment again in 7 days time. If this also fails and you haven’t made a payment by any other method, a failed direct debit charge will be added to your bill and your direct debit will be cancelled. You can reinstate it once your bill has been paid.</p>\n\n<p>Other ways you can pay your bills in this instance are:</p>\n<ul><li>Through your <a href=\"https://id.ee.co.uk/id/login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online account</a></li>\n<li>Call 150 from an EE phone</li>\n<li>Call the EE broadband number 07953 966 250</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"speed\">Check my broadband speed</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you’re just curious or you’re having trouble with your broadband speed, it might be worth running a speed test to see how fast your broadband is actually running.</p>\n\n<p>The two best ways to check your EE broadband speed are:</p>\n<ul><li>Through the <a href=\"https://shop.ee.co.uk/broadband/ee-home-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EE Home app</a></li>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"http://speedtest.btwholesale.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BT speed test</a></li></ul> \n\n<p>Your speed test result will show your <a href=\"/tv-broadband/guides/technical/upload-download-ping/\"><b>download speed, upload speed, and ping</b></a>. You should compare your download and upload speeds to those in your broadband package to see if you’re getting the speeds you should be.</p>\n\n<p>If your speed is below your minimum estimated speed, you can try and speed it up by:</p>\n<ul><li>Using an ethernet cable</li>\n<li>Buying a <a href=\"https://shop.ee.co.uk/broadband/smart-wifi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WiFi extender </a></li>\n<li>Turning off WiFi devices you’re not using</li>\n<li>Moving your router away from other electrical devices</li>\n<li>Moving closer to the router</li>\n<li>Updating antivirus software</li></ul>\n\n<p>If your speed is below your minimum guaranteed speed, you should report it to EE who should be able to fix the problem. If they can’t and you’re still running below your minimum guaranteed speed, you’re free to leave your contract without paying any early termination fees.</p>\n\n<h3>Report speed issues</h3>\n\n<p>If you’ve done a speed test and your broadband is running slower than your minimum guaranteed speed, you should click ‘Further Diagnostics’ on either test and enter your phone number. This will log your test and the EE customer service team will investigate.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can text ‘HELP’ followed by your landline number to 60071. EE will run their own tests on your broadband connection to find out what’s going on. They’ll then call you back within 30 minutes to help solve your issue.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"connection-issues\">Report connection issues</h2>\n\n[tv_broadband_slow_speeds_cta]\n\n<p>If you’re having trouble with your internet connection, the first thing you can try is switching your router off and back on again. This will reconnect your router to the best channel and hopefully improve your broadband speed at the same time. You can do this either at the plug or by using the power button on the back of your router. When the light on your router turns blue, you can try connecting your device again.</p>\n\n<p>If this hasn’t worked, try disconnecting and reconnecting your device from the WiFi. This will make sure that the problem isn’t with your device, but your broadband or router.</p>\n\n<p>If you still need help, you can text ‘HELP’ followed by your landline number to 60071. EE customer service will then run a few tests on your connection remotely and get back to you within 30 minutes to help you solve the problem or book an engineer. Alternatively, you can call 0800 079 8586.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving house with EE</h2>\n\n<p>You should contact EE at least 3 weeks before your moving date to make sure that your broadband is set up and ready to go live when you move in.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this by calling 150 from an EE phone or 0800 079 8586 from any other phone. When you ring, you’ll need to give a few details about your move, including:</p>\n<ul><li>Your current home phone number</li>\n<li>Your current address</li>\n<li>Your new address</li>\n<li>Your moving date</li></ul>\n\n[tv_broadband_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>EE will take care of moving your broadband package over to your new home; all you have to do is <a href=\"https://ee.co.uk/help/help-new/managing-and-using-my-account/moving-home/do-i-need-to-do-anything-once-ive-moved-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set up your router</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that your new home may have different broadband speed and availability, meaning that you may see slower speeds. If this is the case, you might be able to cancel or downgrade your broadband package without paying any cancellation fees.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there may be times where you’re not happy with your broadband service and want to make a complaint.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways you can submit your complaint to EE:</p>\n<ul><li>Call 0800 079 0125</li>\n<li>Fill in the <a href=\"https://ee.co.uk/contact-ee/complaint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online form</a></li>\n<li>Use the complaints <a href=\"https://ee.co.uk/contact-ee/complaint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live chat service</a></li> \n<li>Write to:<br>\nEE Customer Service<br>\n6 Camberwell Way<br>\nSunderland<br>\nTyne and Wear<br>\nSR3 3XN</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you write to EE, along with your complaint, you should include your full name and address, your account or landline number, and an alternative daytime telephone number.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">Switch to EE broadband</h2>\n\n<p>Switching broadband providers has never been easier, especially when it comes to switching to EE broadband, especially if you already have a contract with EE mobile. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re already an EE customer, you can change your broadband package through your online account. Mobile customers can also benefit from up to 20GB of extra data per month when they sign up for a home broadband plan.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a new customer, you can call the EE broadband number on 0800 079 5122 or click the link below to choose your broadband package. Alternatively, you can call Utility Switchboard on <a href=\"+442030484598\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">0203 0484 598</a> to make sure you’re on the right deal.</p>\n\n<center><a href='https://shop.ee.co.uk/broadband' target=\"_blank\" class='curve-btn-main btn-white' rel=\"noopener\">Switch to EE broadband</a></center>\n\n<p>EE will then contact your current provider and start the switching process. This will take around 2 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>If your old broadband provider charges you any early termination fees when you switch, EE will give you £50 credit to cover it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancel\">Cancel your contract</h2>\n\n<p>Closing your EE account and cancelling your broadband contract is extremely easy. All you have to do is contact the supplier you want to switch to and let them do the work for you! If you want to cancel without switching to another provider or want to do it yourself, you can do so by calling 0800 079 0544.</p>\n\n<p>During the first 14 days of the switching process, you can leave at any time without paying any extra fees. However, if you want to leave EE after this, you might have to pay early exit fees. This is usually the case if you’re switching before the end of your minimum term.</p>\n\n<p>You can decide whether you want to keep your EE router or not. You can either:</p>\n<ul><li>Keep your router</li>\n<li>Recycle your router at your local waste management facility</li>\n<li>Return it to:<br>\nEE Returns<br>\n1 First Avenue<br>\nMaybrook Industrial Estate<br>\nMinworth<br>\nBirmingham<br>\nB76 1BA</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you have EE TV, you’ll be sent a Jiffy bag to return your TV box in. If you don’t return your box within 30 days, you’ll be charged £175 on your final bill. </p>\n\n<h3>Early cancellation charges</h3>\n\n<p>Each provider works out their early termination fees differently. How much you pay depends on a number of things, including how much you currently pay and how long is left of your contract.</p>\n\n<p>EE works out your early cancellation fees by:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Taking how much you pay for your broadband per month</li>\n<li>Taking off VAT</li>\n<li>Subtracting any costs EE save from you leaving early</li>\n<li>Subtracting 4% for early payment</li>\n<li>Multiplying by the remainder of your minimum term (in months)</li>\n<li>Adding VAT</li></ol>\n\n<p>For example, if you pay £25 per month for your broadband and cancel with 6 months left on your minimum term, VAT will be taken off, bringing it to £20.83. Then, the costs EE save will be taken off (for example, £13), bringing it to £7.83 and another 4% is taken off for early payment, bringing the fee to £7.52. Multiplying this by 6 (how long is left on the contract) and adding VAT brings your final cancellation fee to £54.14.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s anything else you want to talk about, you can use the methods below to contact the EE customer service team.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>From an EE phone</td> \n        <td>150</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>From a non-EE phone</td> \n        <td>0800 079 8586</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Virtual support (Android)</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ee.ar.virtualsupportar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Virtual support (iOS)</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id1424990298\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Store finder</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://ee.co.uk/store-finder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@EE</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/ee/contact","provider":"EE"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
