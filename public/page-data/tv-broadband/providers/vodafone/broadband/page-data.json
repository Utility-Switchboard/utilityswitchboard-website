With Vodafone Together, you will also receive instant and guaranteed trade-in value for your old mobile.</p>\n\n<p>When you opt for Vodafone Pro Xtra, you can take advantage of a free Apple TV 4K box to watch Ultra High Definition films, shows and box sets. New Apple TV+ customers will also benefit from a free 3-month subscription.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buy-give\">Buy One, Give One</h3>\n\n<p>If you have both your mobile and broadband plans with Vodafone, you’ll be helping out those living in Digital Poverty.</p>\n\n<p>The Buy One, Give One initiative works with The Trussell Trust, an anti-poverty charity that helps support people in financial distress.</p>\n\n<p>For every Vodafone Together household, Vodafone will give someone in need 20GB of data and unlimited calls and texts for up to a year. This will be free for both you and the recipient, who stay connected thanks to you.</p>\n\n<p>Vodafone also works with a number of different charities to help end digital poverty and helps customers donate their old tech to help disadvantaged children access remote learning, connect with loved ones, and stay safe.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/mobile/everyone-connected\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out more about everyone.connected</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"app\">The Vodafone Broadband app</h3>\n\n<p>With the Vodafone Broadband app, you can take control of your WiFi hub and internet usage to make the most of your broadband package.</p>\n\n<p>The app pairs with your router to improve your online experience, boost your speeds, and control your network.</p>\n\n<p>With the app, you can:</p>\n<ul><li>Boost device speeds</li>\n<li>Set custom WiFi schedules</li>\n<li>Share your WiFi connection using a QR code</li>\n<li>See which devices are connected to your network</li>\n<li>Block devices from connecting</li>\n<li>Set up a guest network</li>\n<li>Personalise your settings</li>\n<li>Run diagnostic tests</li>\n<li>View your bills</li>\n<li>Get support through a live chat service</li></ul>\n\n<div class=\"app-store-double\">\n    <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/vodafone-broadband/id985918725\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/6tIOkBxFcLxfaYYwZG3ZRB/e1fc27b6d3e34a179640a88548bd5d2e/download-app-store.png\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.reply.cordless.uk&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/7hmRcicCQzLoZWs5oJZ7Mx/d1ec589bffb6a56079ac155a701b0cc7/download-google-play.png\"></a>\n</div>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/vodafone/contact","category":"contact"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/vodafone/broadband","provider":"Vodafone"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
