On this page, we answer that question and share any other ways you can contact Vodafone.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about my bill(s)</h2>\n\n<p>There are a number of different ways you can pay your bills:</p>\n<ul><li>By direct debit </li>\n<li>Through your <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/myvodafone/faces/usagePayments/manageBillingProfile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online account</a></li>\n<li>By calling 5667 (from a Vodafone mobile)</li>\n<li>By calling 03333 040 191</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can find all of your broadband bills either through your online account or the app. You’ll only be sent paper bills if you specifically ask for them, and you’ll have to pay an extra £1.54 per month. However, you can download your bills from your online account and print them at home for free.</p>\n\n<p>To talk to someone about your bills, you can contact Vodafone on 03333 040 191 or using the live chat service on the Vodafone website.</p>\n\n<h3>What to do if you’re having trouble paying</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re having trouble paying your bills, the first thing you should do is to contact Vodafone. You can do this by calling 191 from a Vodafone mobile or 03333 040 191.</p>\n\n<p>They’ll be happy to help you out with paying your bills by making your payments more manageable. This could include:</p>\n<ul><li>Changing your payment date</li>\n<li>Moving you to a direct debit</li>\n<li>Removing additional services</li>\n<li>Trading in your old devices</li></ul>\n\n<p>For financial help and support, there are many different organisations available to help you out, such as Citizen’s Advice, Money Advice Trust, and The Money Charity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"speed\">Check your broadband speed</h2>\n\n<p>If your broadband seems slow, it might be worth running a speed test to see what speed it’s actually reaching. You’ll likely see different speeds at different times of day, however, it should always be above the minimum speed Vodafone promised when you signed up.</p>\n\n<p>To check your broadband speed, click the button below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/broadband/speed-test\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Run a speed test</a></center>\n\n<p>You should run the test on a laptop that is plugged into your router with an ethernet cable to get the best results. Bear in mind that if you’re on a high-speed FTTP broadband plan, your speed may be higher than you’re seeing due to your device’s maximum speed capability.</p>\n\n<h3>Report speed issues</h3>\n\n<p>If the speed checker shows that your speed is a lot lower than it should be, you should contact Vodafone to try and get it sorted. You can do this using their live chat or by calling 03333 040 191.</p>\n\n<li>Vodafone will also check your speed at their end to see if they can do anything to improve it. For example, they might send out an engineer or give you tips on how you can improve it yourself.</li>\n\n<li>If it can’t be improved, you’ll be given the opportunity to switch broadband providers without having to pay any early cancellation fees.</li>\n\n<h2 id=\"connection-issues\">Fix broadband connection issues</h2>\n\n[tv_broadband_slow_speeds_cta]\n\n<p>No matter which broadband provider you’re with, it’s very likely that you’ll experience connection issues at some point.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve just joined Vodafone, you might see some connection drops or losses in the first few days. This is completely normal while your router finds the right WiFi channel to bring you the best speed. This should straighten itself out within a few days.</p>\n\n<p>If your connection is still dropping out after the first 3 days of going live, the first thing you should try is turning your hub off and on again. Give it a minute or so to connect to the right channel and your connection might be more stable and you might even see improved speeds.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also worth checking that the fault isn’t on Vodafone’s end - there might be works going on or problems with the whole network. Use the link below to find out if this is what’s causing the connection issues.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/network/status-checker\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Check the network status</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’re still having trouble, you should contact Vodafone by calling 03333 040 191 or using the live chat service on their website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving home with Vodafone</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re moving home, you’ll have to contact Vodafone’s customer service team at least 30 days before your moving date to make sure the process goes as smoothly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to bring Vodafone with you to your new home, you’ll have to call them on 03333 040 191 with your:</p>\n<ul><li>Account number</li>\n<li>Current address</li>\n<li>New address</li>\n<li>Moving date</li></ul>\n\n<p>You’ll need to bring your current Vodafone router with you when you move to stay connected. When you get set up, you’ll also have to perform a factory reset on your router by inserting a pin into the hole near the power button for 15 seconds. This will reset your router and any settings you’ve changes (including your WiFi name and password).</p>\n\n[tv_broadband_moving_house_cta] \n\n<p>If you don’t want Vodafone to be your broadband provider when you move, you’ll have to contact Vodafone to cancel your broadband plan. You can do this by calling 03333 040 191 with your account number.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re moving before the end of your contract, you might have to pay early termination fees. These will be calculated depending on how much you pay for your broadband currently and how long is left on your contract.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Contact the Vodafone complaints team</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something you’re not happy with, you might want to make a complaint to Vodafone about your broadband service.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to do this is by calling the Vodafone complaints team on 03333 040 441. </p>\n\n<p>You can also make your complaint using the Vodafone live chat, filling out the <a href=\"https://complaints.vodafone.co.uk/resource?id=9038116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online form</a> or writing to:</p>\n\n<p>Customer Relations Manager<br>\nVodafone Ltd<br>\nThe Connection<br>\nNewbury<br>\nBerkshire<br>\nRG14 2FN</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/help-and-information/complaints/contact-us-2\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a complaint</a></center>\n\n<p>Once you’ve made your complaint, you’ll hear back from Vodafone within 5 days (or 2 weeks if you wrote to them). They’ll let you know what they’re doing to get the problem resolved and keep you updated on how it’s going.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">Switch to Vodafone</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve decided that Vodafone is the broadband provider for you, you’ll need to check if Vodafone is available in your area and what speeds you can get. You can do this using the link below or by calling 08080 408 408.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/broadband\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Switch to Vodafone</a></center>\n\n<p>If fibre broadband isn’t available in your area yet, you might not be able to switch to Vodafone. They don’t offer any ADSL broadband packages, however, they do offer 4G and 5G GigaCubes and mobile WiFi. Find out more <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/mobile-broadband-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re already a Vodafone broadband customer, you can call 08080 057 392 to change or upgrade your current broadband plan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancel\">Cancel Vodafone contract</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to cancel your broadband package and switch to another provider, you’ll have to call the Vodafone customer service team on 03333 040 191. They can help close your account and make sure your package is cancelled properly.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t have a Fibre to the Home broadband plan, you can cancel your account by simply contacting your new provider. They can take care of the whole switching process for you, including cancelling your current broadband package.</p>\n\n<p>You can cancel your broadband package in the first 14 days without paying any extra charges. If your broadband has gone live in the first 14 days, you’ll still have to pay for any services you’ve used, including:</p>\n<ul><li>Line rental</li>\n<li>Extras you’ve bought</li>\n<li>Extras not covered by your line rental (eg. international and premium calls)</li>\n<li>Any activation, installation, and maintenance fees you agreed to when setting up </li></ul>\n\n<h3>Cancellation fees</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to cancel your broadband package before your contract is up, you might have to pay early cancellation fees.</p>\n\n<p>Your termination fee is calculated by taking the price of your broadband package, multiplying it by how long is left on your contract, and subtracting a 2% discount for paying in a lump sum.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you pay £25 per month and have 4 months left on your contract, this would be calculated by £25 x 4 = £100 - 2% = £98.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also have to pay this termination fee if you’re moving house and aren’t bringing Vodafone with you or are moving abroad. However, if Vodafone broadband isn’t available at your new home, you won’t have to, as long as you’re staying in the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If what you want to talk about hasn’t been covered above, there are many more ways you can contact Vodafone.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Vodafone customer services</td> \n        <td>03333 040 191</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Sales</td>\n        <td> 08080 408 408</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Live chat</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/contact-us-b2/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/vodafoneUK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/vodafoneuk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@VodafoneUK</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h3>How do I speak to a person at Vodafone?</h3>\n\n<p>In the live chat, tell the chatbot, TOBi, “I want to speak to a human” after the first and second message and then answer the rest of his questions.
