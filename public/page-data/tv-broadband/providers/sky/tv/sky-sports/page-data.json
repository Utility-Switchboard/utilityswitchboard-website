It’s one of the biggest attractions of customers changing to or setting up with Sky. Because of Sky Sports growing size, it can be difficult to manage your way through all the different deals and channels available on offer. Hopefully, this guide will go a long way in helping you understand more about what Sky Sports offers.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"What\">What is Sky Sports?</h2> \n\n<p>Sky Sports is one of the <u>biggest selling points</u> of Sky TV. It was first launched in 1990, and was largely responsible for the Premier League breakaway from the English Football League.</p> \n\n<p>Since the Premier League’s first season in 1992, Sky has broadcast the vast majority of its football games across the length of a season from August-May.</p> \n\n<p>It has changed a lot over the years, with one of its original channel formats being numerical, ordering their channels as Sky Sports 1, Sky Sports 2… you get the idea.</p> \n\n<p>In 2017, Sky decided to alter this service and turn their channels into dedicated places for the sports it has broadcasting rights to. So Sky Sports 1 became Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports 2 became Sky Sports Cricket. This format has seen them expand their challenge range and therefore the variety of the sport they broadcast.</p> \n\n<p>Sky Sports isn’t only available on Sky TV. It’s available across <strong>most other TV platforms</strong> such as BT TV, Virgin Media, and TalkTalk TV.</p> \n\n<h2 id=\"Cost\">How much does Sky Sports cost?</h2> \n\n<p>The standard prices of Sky Sports can alter both depending on your contract with Sky and what Sky Sports channels you have.</p> \n\n<p>In many ways, it’s completely up to you as to how much Sky Sports ends up costing you and your household.</p> \n\n<p>These are the standard prices for Sky Sports if you’re already a Sky customer:</p> \n\n<ul><li>No Contract/31 day rolling package = <b>£18 per month.</b> Adding an individual channel to your package costs an extra £4 on top of this £18 price.</li> \n<li>Complete sports fixed price = <b>£25 per month.</b></li> \n<li>Complete sports no contract = <b>£30 per month.</b></li></ul> \n\n<p>In some cases, these prices may vary, but this will always be outlined in the small print of the contract you have with Sky. Make sure you read it!</p> \n\n<p>When purchasing Sky Sports through Sky, you will need to have the base TV package in place in order to be eligible to have Sky Sports. This base package is called Sky Signature and costs £26 a month.</p> \n\n<p>There’s a lot of discounts Sky Sports offers, and they’ll be discussed further down on this page.</p> \n\n<p>Sky Sports prices will vary across the different tv platforms, so the prices on BT and Virgin Media will be part of the tv deals they include.</p> \n\n<p>You can watch Sky Sports on BT by having a NOW membership and choosing the Sports flexible packages BT offer. These prices start are:</p> \n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Big Sport</strong> = £40 per month</li> \n<li><strong>VIP</strong> = £65 per month</li>\n</ul> \n\n<p>Virgin Media’s offers are incredibly limited, and are made more expensive by the fact that Virgin broadband is included in every bundle.</p> \n\n<p>The prices of packages that include Sky Sports are <b>£79 per month</b> or <b>£99 per month.</b></p> \n\n\n<h2 id=\"Channels\">The channels Sky sports offers</h2>\n\n<p>Sky Sports is so popular because of its diversity of channels. The current format they have means that if you buy the complete sports package, you have 11 sports channels to choose from!</p> \n\n<ol><li><b>Sky Sports Main Event</b> - Airs the major sports and matches from those sports such as big Premier League clashes and British &amp; Irish International Rugby Union matches, for example.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports Premier League</b> - A channel dedicated to broadcasting Premier league matches either mid-week or at weekends.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports Football</b> - This channel shows football games from other leagues across the UK, such as EFL Championship and SPFL (Scottish Premiership Football League). International qualifiers and Nation League matches are also shown on this channel.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports Cricket</b> - Broadcasts international test, ODI, and T20 matches for England’s men and women’s teams, both home and away. Also shows live domestic cricket from the County Championship and domestic ODI and T20 competitions.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports Golf</b> - Dedicated to show the world’s major Golf tournaments such as the Ryder Cup, the Masters, and other majors throughout the year.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports F1</b> - A channel that only shows Formula 1. It broadcasts the Grand Prixs, the qualifying, and the practices, plus Formula 2, Formula 3, and IndyCar series from the US.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports Action</b> - This shows sports such as Rugby, NFL, NBA, and Netball.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports Arena</b> - Offers coverage of sports such as Darts and Rugby League.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports Racing</b> - Shows only horseracing from courses around the UK, and some from the US. This is available with Sky Signature.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports Mix</b> - Offers a wide variety of sports and is available with the Sky Signature base package.</li> \n<li><b>Sky Sports News</b> - A channel where you can catch up on sporting news from around the world. This is also included with Sky Signature.</li> \n</ol>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"One\">What if you only want 1 Sky Sports Channel?</h3> \n\n<p>If you want only 1, or specific, Sky Sports channels, then the best way for you to receive this would be to sign up for the No contract/31 day rolling deal that this page mentioned earlier.</p> \n\n<p>With this, you pick the channels you want for your favourite sports. Think of it as a sports buffet, you pick the bits you want the most!</p> \n\n<p>You can add up to 3 different channels to the No contract deal, and each channel you add will cost you an extra 4 pounds. Because the sports channel included in the initial £18 monthly price is counted, you can pick two more channels.</p> \n\n<p>Once you hit three channels (£26 a month), you won’t be allowed to add any more. If you reach this point, it would be better if you swapped to the complete sports fixed price contract. You’d be saving yourself money whilst getting more content.</p> \n\n\n<h2 id=\"Contract\">How long is the contract?</h2> \n\n<p>When you sign up for Sky Sports, or any Sky products for that matter, the standard contract length is 12 to 18 months.</p> \n\n<p>Therefore, it’s highly likely that the contract for your Sky Sports package will also be either 12 or 18 months long.</p> \n\n<p>Sometimes, the length of contracts can extend to 24 months, but this is something you’ll have to check with Sky as to whether this is available for your specific package or not.</p> \n\n\n<h2 id=\"New\">Can new customers get Sky Sports offers?</h2> \n\n<p>New customers to Sky do have access to offers from Sky Sports. They all vary in price and each has different qualities.</p> \n\n<p>Here’s the breakdown of some of the Sky sports offers available to new customers.</p> \n\n<ul>\n<li>Sky TV and Sky Sports are available to new customers from £41 per month, with a set-up cost of £20 as part of Sky Q deals. This price is for an 18 month contract. Sky states that the prices could change during this period.</li>\n<li>Sky Sports and BT Sports are available for a more expensive fee of £65 with a set up fee of £20. This includes all the subscription 8 Sky Sports channels, and BT Sports 1, 2 &amp; 3, along with BT Sport ESPN.</li>\n<li>You can <i>build your own</i> package at a starting price of £26 per month for Sky Signature, and then Sky Sports is offered as an additional extra for an added £20 per month, which would take the total of this Sky package to £46 per month.</li>\n</ul> \n\n\n<h2 id=\"Existing\">Can existing customers get offers?</h2> \n\n<p>Discounted offers aren’t just reserved for new customers to Sky and Sky Sports. Current customers of Sky are also eligible for Sky Sports deals.</p> \n\n<ul>\n<li>One of the first offers advertised to current customers is the potential to upgrade and gain Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Football for an extra £18 per month. On top of the Sky Signature package you already pay £26 per month for, this will take the total costs of your Sky packages to £44 per month. Remember, you’ll only have access to the Premier League and Football sports channels, no others!</li>\n<li>For the complete Sky Sports package, which includes every subscription Sky Sports channel, this will be an extra £22 per month, taking total costs for Sky up to £48 per month.</li>\n</ul> \n\n<p>Sky does state that the prices may change in this period.</p> \n\n\n<h3 id=\"Expensive\">Why has Sky Sports become so expensive?</h3> \n\n\n<p>It’s possible that the price you pay for your Sky Sports deals will change at some point during the length of your contract. This can be for several reasons, some of which are out of Sky’s control such as a rise in inflation. Sky may have to increase their price to match this rise.</p> \n\n<p>Another reason could be that you have come to the end of your minimum contract length of 12/18/24 months with Sky, and moving forwards, they’re looking to increase the prices of their packages, meaning that you may end up paying more for Sky Sports.</p> \n\n<p>Sky should let you know about any potential increases in the prices of these products at least 30 days before they plan to implement these changes.</p> \n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Not-Working\">What if Sky Sports isn’t working?</h2> \n\n<p>More often than not, if Sky Sports isn’t working, it’s likely there’s a problem with your Sky box rather than the channel itself. There are ways in which you can fix this problem.</p> \n\n<blockquote>Try rebooting your Sky box. For this to work, you need to switch off your Sky Box directly at the main socket. Check that all the lights are off and that the box has no power. Leave this for a few minutes and then try restarting your box again.</blockquote>\n\n\n<p>If this doesn’t work, then it could be a problem with your Sky software, your Sky remote, or even the weather! Bad weather may have knocked your satellite dish into a position with poor signal, so that could be something to check on.</p> \n\n\n<p>If you’d like to get in touch with Sky for further information and help then the number to call is <b>03337592894.</b></p>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/contact","category":"contact"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/tv/sky-sports","provider":"Sky"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
