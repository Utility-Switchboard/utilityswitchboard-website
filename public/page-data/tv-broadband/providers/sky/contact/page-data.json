Whether you want to manage your payments, change billing details, or there’s something wrong, there are a few things you can try.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Call 0333 759 0340</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/myaccount/bill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Online</a></li>\n<li>Through the <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/my-sky-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app</a></li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/home/broadband/your-account/account-my-bills-and-payments\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Help with your bills</a></center>\n\n<h3>If you’re having trouble paying…</h3>\n\n<p>Companies are more understanding than you might think if you’re struggling to pay your bills. The best thing to do is to contact Sky by phone on 0333 759 2283 as soon as possible. If you can avoid running up too much debt with them, there are more options for you to take.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, Sky lets you make payments as often as you like where you can choose the amount and frequency of your payments to stay in control and less likely to fall into debt.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/myaccount/bill/pay\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a payment</a></center>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that if you don’t pay by your due date, you may be charged a £10 late payment fee. However, if you contact Sky by phone, you might be able to convince them to waive this until you get back on track.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"speed\">Check your broadband speed</h2>\n\n<p>If your broadband is running slow, or you’re just curious about your internet speed, you can easily test your broadband speed through your online account.</p>\n\n<p>Simply sign in with your Sky iD and Sky will run tests on your connection to check your speed or find out what might be causing any issues.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a third party speed checker, but if you’re planning on reporting slow broadband or claiming money back on it, you’ll have to use Sky’s one. This is because it goes through your online account so customer service advisors can see it.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/mybroadband\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Test your broadband speed</a></center>\n\n<h3>Report speed issues</h3>\n\n<p>If you’ve checked your broadband speed through your online account, and it’s lower than the minimum speed (which you can find through your online account or on your order confirmation), you should contact Sky on 0333 759 0340.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re on the Superfast or Ultrafast packages, you’ll receive the Speed Guarantee after the first 14 days. If your speed falls below the minimum for at least 3 consecutive days, you’ll get one month’s worth of your money back.</p>\n\n<h3>Get a WiFi booster</h3>\n\n<p>If your WiFi signal is rubbish in some rooms, you can easily buy a booster. This can be either plugged into the wall or straight into your PC to improve the signal being sent to your device.</p>\n\n<p>If you meet all of the criteria below, you might be able to get a free one from Sky by calling 0333 759 0340.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Subscribe to Broadband Boost</li>\n<li>Have less than 3Mbps download speed in every room</li>\n<li>An engineer cannot fix the problem</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://accessories.sky.com/catalogue/products/sky-wireless-booster\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Get a WiFi booster</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"connection-issues\">Connection issues</h2>\n\n[tv_broadband_slow_speeds_cta]\n\n<p>As with most technical problems, the first thing you should try is either resetting or restarting your router. You can do this either at the wall or using the power/reset button on the back. If, when you turn it back on, the lights turn green or white (depending on the router type) and stay that way, your connection should be back up and running.</p>\n\n<p>If the lights are a different colour or are flashing, you can use the link below to find out what each one means.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/home/broadband/my-broadband-speed/no-connection-slow-wifi/diagnostics/sky-broadband-diagnostic/which-sky-hub-do-you-have-no\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">What's wrong with my router?</a></center>\n\n<p>It could be a problem with your device. Make sure that your WiFi is turned on and flight mode is off. If your WiFi is on, try turning it off and back on again or disconnecting and reconnecting to the router. It may be that you’re trying to connect to the wrong one.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re still having trouble, you can contact Sky by phone on 0333 759 2270. You can also visit the Sky Broadband Forum where other customers might be able to help.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving house</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re moving house, you need to let Sky know so that they can either cancel your broadband package or activate it in your new home.</p>\n\n<p>When you know your moving date, you’ll have to give Sky 2 weeks’ notice. You can call them on 0333 759 0913 to let them know:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your moving date</li>\n<li>Your new address</li>\n<li>The date to switch off services at your current address</li></ul>\n\n[tv_broadband_moving_house_cta] \n\n<p>There might be an activation fee to set Sky Broadband up when you move in which will vary depending on your broadband package. You can change your package when you call about your moving day or through your online account (this might make setting up cheaper).</p>\n\n<p>If your current speed can’t be offered at your new home, you can change or cancel your contract without having to pay any exit fees (a bulk payment for however much you owe for the rest of your contract). If you can get the speeds but don’t after 14 days, you can also switch with no exit fees.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/moving-home-with-sky\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move house with Sky</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re not happy with your Sky Broadband package or service, you might want to make a complaint about it to Sky.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways you can do this:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Call 03300 413 019</li>\n<li>Through the live chat service</li>\n<li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Write to:<br>\nCustomer Complaints<br>\nSky Subscribers Services Ltd<br>\nPO Box 43<br>\nLivingston<br>\nWest Lothian<br>\nEH54 7DD</li></ul>\n\n<p>Once you’ve made your complaint, the customer service team will try to resolve your problem as soon as possible. They’ll give you an estimated time scale for a resolution and send updates throughout the process.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve made your complaint in writing, Sky will attempt to call you about the situation, but if you haven’t left your phone number, they’ll write back instead so make sure you include some contact detail along with your complaint.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/home/your-account/making-a-complaint/how-to-make-a-complaint/articles/how-to-make-a-complaint\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a complaint</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancel\">Cancel your Sky Broadband package</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re thinking of cancelling your broadband package and switching to a new provider, you’ll have to give Sky 14 days notice.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways you can cancel your broadband, but you’ll have to confirm that you’re the account holder.</p>\n\n<p>You can cancel your broadband package:</p>\n\n<ul><li>By calling 0333 759 0913</li>\n<li>Through their live chat</li>\n<li>Email mysky@sky.com</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you’re not switching to a Fibre to the Premises provider (for example, Virgin Media cable, BT Ultrafast Fibre, etc), you don’t have to contact Sky to cancel; your new provider can do it for you when you switch.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/cancel-sky-broadband\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Cancel Sky Broadband</a></center>\n\n<h3>Sky cancellation fees</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re switching mid-contract, you might have to pay early cancellation fees. These will vary depending on how much your package costs and how long is left on your contract.</p>\n\n<p>To work out your cancellation fees, Sky will take your monthly payments and deduct:</p>\n\n<ul><li>20% VAT</li>\n<li>The costs they’re saving by you leaving early</li>\n<li>A discount for early payment</li></ul>\n\n<p>For example, if you pay £30 per month for your broadband with 3 months left on your contract, Sky will start by taking off VAT, business costs, and early payment discounts, bringing it down to £16.39. This will then be multiplied by 3 (the amount of time left on your contract) to give you a cancellation fee of £49.17. However, this will then be rounded to the nearest 25p, leaving you with a final fee of £49.25.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you want to talk about that we haven’t covered here, you can use the methods below to contact Sky by phone, email, and post.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone</td>\n        <td>0333 759 0340</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td><a href=\"mailto:mysky@sky.uk\">mysky@sky.uk</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Write to:</td>\n        <td>Sky Subscriber Services Ltd<br>\n            PO Box 43<br>\n            Livingston<br>\n            West Lothian<br>\n            EH54 7DD</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Sky Community Forum</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://helpforum.sky.com/t5/Broadband/bd-p/sky_broadband\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/tv/sky-sports","category":"sky-sports"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/tv","category":"tv"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/contact","provider":"Sky"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
