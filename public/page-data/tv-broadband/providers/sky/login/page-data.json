Otherwise, you won’t be able to login into your account at all.</p> \n\n<p>Creating a Sky iD is very straightforward. Like most other sites, whether it be an Amazon or Netflix account, you’ll need to use your email address and create a password. An important thing to remember is that you can only have one primary Sky iD per account.</p> \n\n<center><a href=\"https://skyid.sky.com/signup/skycom\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Create an account</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’ve already got this in place and are already a Sky customer, then you should be able to access My Sky with no problems at all.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Login\">Using My Sky login and Logging in and using your account</h2> \n\n<p>Once you’re in and if you need immediate help with anything, then Sky has broken down the potential issue areas into categories, so that you’ll be able to find the resolution to your problem quicker. These categories are:</p> \n<ul><li>Account and subscription</li>\n<li>Bills and payments</li> \n<li>Sky iD</li>\n<li>Moving home</li> \n<li>Orders and appointments</li> \n<li>Making a complaint</li> \n<li>Information and policies</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://skyid.sky.com/signin\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Log in to your Sky account</a></center>\n\n<p>Inside most of these categories are further sub-categories that’ll deal with your specific problem. The only areas where these aren’t included are in Sky iD and Moving home.</p> \n\n<p>There’s also a list of Frequently read articles below these categories that give you an opportunity to address any problems you may be experiencing, whether that be scam and fraud concerns, fixing problems with your Sky Broadband, or changing your payment methods.</p> \n\n<h2 id=\"Login-help\">Needing help with My Sky login</h2> \n\n<p>If you need help logging into your Sky account, it may be because you’ve typed in the wrong password too many times!</p> \n\n<p>Don’t worry, we’ve all been there! It’s really simple to sort out, Sky will ask for either the email or username for your account so they can send you a link to reset your password.If not, try the link below.</p> \n\n<center><a href=\"https://skyid.sky.com/resetpassword/skycom\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Reset your Sky password</a></center>\n\n<p>The link Sky sends will be sent either by email or via an SMS message.</p> \n\n<h2 id=\"Navigate-account\"> Navigating through your Sky account easily</h2> \n\n<p>Once you’re set up, you’ll be able to use your My Sky to manage your entire account all in one place. This includes managing what TV and broadband packages you may have through Sky, and changing the time and date of an engineer appointment to your address if you encounter any problems with your Sky box or satellite signal.</p> \n\n<p>However, just be careful you don’t accidentally give yourself extra charges to your Sky bill if you need to change your engineer’s appointment. Make sure you change in plenty of time, and not on the day or the day before a scheduled visit. Otherwise, you may be charged an extra £25 on your next bill.</p> \n\n<p>Speaking of bills, My Sky is a great place to manage all of your monthly, and even annual, payment plans you have set up with Sky. They break everything down for you so you know exactly what you’re paying each month and what outstanding balances you may have on your account.</p> \n\n<p>If this is the case, and you maybe have some payments to catch up on, don’t worry! Sky will send you a notification, most likely to your email address or as a text message, about an overdue bill and you’ll be able to sort the problem out straight away.</p> \n\n<h3 id=\"Can-do-My-Sky\">What you can do with My Sky?</h3> \n\n<p>There’s loads of things you’ll be able to do with My Sky, including:</p> \n\n<ul><li>Managing bills</li> \n<li>Changing important details such as telephone number, home address etc.</li> \n<li>Edit your payment plans</li> \n<li>Changing current package deal</li> \n<li>Cancelling Sky subscriptions</li> \n<li>+ much more!</li></ul> \n\n<p>My Sky enables you to change what packages and deals you pay for through Sky. If you’re looking to cut back costs, or upgrade your current deal, then your account enables you to make any changes you like so you can update everything to best suit your needs.</p> \n\n<p>If you’re a Sky Broadband customer, you’ll also be able to check if Sky is sticking to their required download speeds for the package you have through them. These download speed checks are called ‘Broadband Health Checkers’.</p>\n\n<p>My Sky will outline what these download speeds should be, and there’s also the option of conducting a quick line check, just to make sure everything is in order.</p> \n\n<p>Please note, you have to be an active Sky Broadband customer in order to do this. It doesn’t work if you are with BT, Virgin Media, or other broadband network companies.</p> \n\n<h2 id=\"Find-Sky-details\">Where to find My Sky login details and how to change them</h2> \n\n<p>You’ll be able to find your account username and number online through the My Sky web page, or on any billing email or documentation you receive from Sky, so don’t get rid of that paper!</p>  \n\n<p>Once you’re logged into your Sky account, you’ll be able to change your details whenever necessary, let’s say if you change mobile numbers or move home.</p> \n\n<p>At some point, you may want to change your password. There are many ways in which you can do this. One way to change your password is to click on the ‘forgotten password’ option on the homepage. From there, you’ll be asked to create a new password which will then become your default one until you decide to change it again.</p> \n\n<p>Because issues of privacy and security are taken very seriously, there may be instances where Sky has reset your password (this may happen if you try to log in and fail too many times, or your account is accessed from an unknown location/device).</p> \n\n<p>You’ll know it’s been changed because Sky will never reset your password without telling you, unless it’s a matter where suspicious activity is suspected. They will always give you a pre-advanced warning that these changes are incoming and that you’ll need to reset your password in the not too distant future.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no need to worry if this occurs, because you’ll be able to create a new password for your My Sky login by clicking on the ‘reset your password’ option, where you’ll be asked to enter either your email or your username.</p> \n\n<p>If you still can’t access your account, Sky has a call line available that you can ring at +443442 411 280 and someone will be able to help you out with your account issues, including creating a new password for your account.</p> \n\n\n<h2 id=\"Use-App\">Using the My Sky app</h2> \n\n<p>With technology becoming more integral to our everyday lives, apps are a great way for us to login and manage our finances and accounts all in one place on our smartphones.</p> \n\n<p>My Sky has an app readily available for its customers to download to make the process of managing your Sky accounts even quicker and even easier.</p> \n\n<p>It’s really easy to login into the My Sky app too. If you’re already a Sky customer, then you can sign into the app using your username and password. If not, you’ll have to create an account in order to login into the My Sky app.</p> \n\n<p>The app is broken down into different sections along the bottom of your screen for your Home page, Sky TV, Sky Broadband, Mobile, and Sky VIP so you can click on whatever icon you want depending on what you need.</p> \n\n<p>On the app, you can manage your account in exactly the same way as you can on a desktop device. The app is also free to use, so there’s no extra charge you’re paying Sky for.</p> \n\n<p>The app is available to download through the Apple app store for iPhone or Google Play for Android devices.</p> \n\n<div class=\"app-store-double\">\n    <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/my-sky-app/id880575127\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/6tIOkBxFcLxfaYYwZG3ZRB/e1fc27b6d3e34a179640a88548bd5d2e/download-app-store.png\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bskyb.skyservice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/7hmRcicCQzLoZWs5oJZ7Mx/d1ec589bffb6a56079ac155a701b0cc7/download-google-play.png\"></a>\n</div>\n\n <p>There’s also some minimum system requirements that Sky have in place, so depending on what phone and/or tablet you have currently, and what OS version you have, you may only be able to download certain Sky apps. To check what is and isn’t compatible with your device, go to Sky’s website on this issue by <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/app-desktop-lookup\">clicking here.</a></p>\n\n <h3 id=\"Where-else-to-use\"> Where else can you use My Sky login?</h3> \n\n<p>You can use My Sky in your home on your computer, or you can use it on the go with your smartphones or tablets.</p> \n\n<p>You can't, however, use your My Sky details for anything other than Sky-related matters. So, for example, if you pay for the Sky TV &amp; Netflix package, you cannot use your details for the Netflix app that’ll be included in this deal. This is because Netflix is a separate company that partners with Sky to create this bundle, and you’ll need to set up a separate account for Netflix using a different username and password.</p> \n\n<p>This is also the same for other streaming services that may be included in your Sky TV deal, such as Amazon Prime, Disney +, and Britbox.</p> \n\n<h2 id=\"VIP\">Sky VIP</h2>\n\n<p>Downloading the My Sky app means that you have access to Sky VIP, a loyalty programme designed for Sky customers.</p> \n\n<p>Sky VIP can only be accessed via the My Sky App.</p> \n\n<p>If this isn’t an option, then there are options on Sky’s website to either message, call, email, or chat via British Sign Language with Sky to see how you can access your rewards.</p> \n\n<p>The Sky VIP programme has different levels depending on how long you’ve been a Sky customer for.</p> \n\n<ul><li><b>Silver: 0-3 Years</b> - Enables you to have immersive experiences and access to Sky VR.</li>  \n<li><b>Gold: 3-8 Years</b> - Includes everything at Silver, plus free fibre setup for your broadband and Sky Go Extra (which you can access offline).</li> \n<li><b>Platinum: 8-15 Years</b> - Everything included at Silver and Gold, plus free rewards with Sky Mobile and Sky Q.</li> \n<li><b>Diamond: 15+ Years</b> - Can skip the queue to speak to Sky’s help team, and have entertainment charged at exclusive discount rates via the Sky Soundbox system.</li></ul> \n\n<p>Anyone who joins Sky VIP receives a welcome gift when first signing up. Sky created this system as a way of saying thank you to its customers who used their company for either TV, Broadband, Mobile, or all of them!</p> \n\n<p>Follow this link to sign up to Sky VIP</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/getting-started-sky-vip\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Signing up to Sky VIP</a></center>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/tv/sky-sports","category":"sky-sports"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/contact","category":"contact"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/sky/login","provider":"Sky"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
