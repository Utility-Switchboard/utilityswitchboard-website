As a large, multi-service provider, Sky has a huge range of add-ons available to improve your broadband deal, from TV bundles to subscription services.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bundles\">Sky TV and broadband bundles</h3>\n\n<p>Broadband bundles allow customers to save money on their broadband and TV packages when they’re bought together. It’s well-known that Sky TV is very highly-priced, so it’s no surprise their TV and broadband bundles are a popular choice.</p>\n\n<p>These bundles come with Sky TV, either superfast or ultrafast broadband, Netflix, and Pay as You Talk home phone service. There are also a number of different TV extras available to add to your bundles, such as sports, cinema, kids’ channels, multi-screen, and HD.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/deals/tvandbroadband\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Compare TV and broadband deals</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"boost\">Sky Broadband Boost</h3>\n\n<p>Sky Broadband Boost can be added to any of the three broadband packages for £5 per month.
