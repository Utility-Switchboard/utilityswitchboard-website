The only NOW TV pass worth paying the £4 for is the Sports pass as you’ll still be saving £9.99 overall (after paying the £4) whereas you won’t save anything on the Entertainment pass and just £1 on the Movies pass.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you’re looking for a quality set-top box enabling access to Freeview channels, pause and rewind, and having all of your streaming services in one place, TalkTalk TV is a good option.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, TalkTalk TV can be cancelled at any time with no cancellation fees as it works on a 30-day rolling contract, automatically renewing every month. So, if you sign up and it’s not for you, you can easily cancel the contract through your TalkTalk online account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"watch-online\">Watch TalkTalk TV online</h2>\n\n<p>If your TalkTalk TV box is already in use, you can easily watch TalkTalk TV online. There are a few different ways you can do this.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not watching live or Sky TV channels, you can watch through the TalkTalk TV app. You can register up to 4 devices per account and can watch your favourite shows and films while the TalkTalk TV box is being used elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Up to 4 devices can be registered to an account, however, only one can watch at a time (excluding your TV box). All you have to do to register a device is sign in through the app and once you’ve reached 4 devices, you can add and remove them through your online account.</p>\n\n<p>To start watching on the TalkTalk TV app, you’ll need:</p>\n<li>A TalkTalk account</li>\n<li>A TalkTalk TV subscription</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/Articles/TalkTalk-TV-compatibility/ta-p/2225045\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compatible device</a></li>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blinkbox.tablet.live&amp;hl=en_GB\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for Android</a></center>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id402426509\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n\n<p>Another way you can watch TalkTalk TV is through your web browser, as long as you’re running on Windows 7 and above or iOS Yosemite and above. Which devices are compatible can change depending on the latest updates.</p>\n\n<p>TalkTalk TV is available to watch on-demand on:</p>\n<ul><li>Chrome</li>\n<li>Firefox</li>\n<li>Edge</li>\n<li>Safari (version 9 and above)</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.talktalktv.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch TalkTalk TV online</a></center>\n\n<p>Because TalkTalk works with NOW to give you a wider variety of content available, you can watch in even more places using your NOW TV account.</p>\n\n<p>With NOW TV, you can watch on 2 extra devices at a time, meaning that you can watch 4 different shows in 4 places at a time. You can also have 6 devices registered to your account.</p>\n\n<p>You can watch NOW TV through:</p>\n<ul><li>Most smart sticks and TVs</li>\n<li>The NOW TV desktop app</li>\n<li>Android 5.0 or higher</li>\n<li>iOS 11 or higher</li>\n<li>Your TalkTalk TV box</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://help.nowtv.com/article/get-now-on-my-device\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch NOW TV</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"tv-store\">TalkTalk TV store</h3>\n\n<p>Customers can use the TalkTalk TV store to rent or buy some of the newest and most popular films. With over 700 films available to rent the same day as their DVD release and before other subscription services, you can rent as many films as you like from the store.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also receive a voucher for £5 off your first film every month. Simply press the ‘More TV’ button on your remote, and you’ll find your voucher code under ‘Showcase’. Once you’ve chosen your film, make sure to click the ‘Add Voucher’ button and enter your code to receive your discount.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.talktalktv.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Access the TV Store</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"second-box\">Get a second TalkTalk TV box</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to be able to watch TalkTalk TV in two places at once, you can add Multi-room to your fibre broadband and TV package.</p>\n\n<p>With Multi-room, both of your TV boxes can watch:</p>\n<ul><li>Free-to-air channels (each with a working aerial)</li>\n<li>On-demand or catch-up services</li>\n<li>Netflix</li>\n<li>NOW TV</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can also pause your show on one box and continue watching on the second one or watch two different channels at the same time. However, if you’re trying to watch the same channel on the two boxes (not including free-to-air), you may experience issues.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-room is free for TalkTalk TV customers, but you’ll have to pay a one-off fee of £25 for a second TalkTalk TV box and a £25 set-up fee.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.talktalk.co.uk/shop/multiroom\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Upgrade to Multiroom</a></center>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/talktalk/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/talktalk/contact","category":"contact"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/talktalk/tv","provider":"TalkTalk"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
