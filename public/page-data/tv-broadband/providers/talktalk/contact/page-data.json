Here, we have all the right numbers and methods of getting in touch to get your problem solved.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about my bills</h2>\n\n<p>Billing issues can be very stressful, especially when it comes to your TV and broadband packages. Being without broadband or a landline can put a stop to everything so it’s important that billing issues are sorted as soon as possible to avoid having them cut off.</p>\n\n<p>With TalkTalk, you’ll receive your bills through your online account. However, you can change to paper billing if you’d prefer. Simply log in to your account and click ‘choose billing method’ under ‘Bills and Payments’. If you opt for paper billing, you’ll be charged £2.75 per bill.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to contact TalkTalk with a question about your bill, you can call 0345 172 0088 or use the TalkTalk <a href=\"https://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/Articles/Our-live-chat-team/ta-p/2230529\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live chat service</a> on their website.</p>\n\n<h3>If you’re having trouble paying</h3>\n\n<p>If you don’t pay your TalkTalk broadband bill, your services could be restricted. These restrictions will be lifted once you’ve paid off your outstanding balance, which you can do through your online account or by calling the automated payment line on 0345 172 0040.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.talktalk.co.uk/my/billsandpayments\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a payment</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’re struggling to pay your bill and can’t make the one-off payment, you might be able to request a payment extension through your online account. You can pay as much or as little as you like at a time and, as long as your bill is paid by the date you’ve committed to, you won’t lose any of your services or have them restricted.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can contact TalkTalk by calling 0345 456 5598. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"speed\">Check your broadband speed</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you’re having speed issues or just curious about how fast your broadband is running, you might want to conduct a speed test to see what’s going on.</p>\n\n<p>Simply click the button below and TalkTalk will do a 2-minute test to see how your broadband is performing.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.talktalk.co.uk/speedcheck/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Run a speed test</a></center>\n\n<p>The best way to conduct a speed test is using a newer desktop PC or laptop either near or connected to the router while no one else is online. This will make sure you get the most accurate results. Older and handheld devices are less able to handle high WiFi speeds, so the test may come up with lower speeds than you’re running at.</p>\n\n<h3>Report speed issues</h3>\n\n<p>If you’ve run a speed test and the results are within the estimated speed range (which you’ll find in your welcome pack), everything should be working normally - you shouldn’t see any problems with your internet. However, if they’re lower than they should be, you should contact TalkTalk to find out what’s happening.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this by calling 0345 172 0088 or through the TalkTalk live chat service. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re not happy with your speeds within your first 30 days of being with TalkTalk, you can also cancel your contract with no early disconnection fees. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"connection-issues\">Connection issues</h2>\n\n<p>In the first 14 days of being with TalkTalk, you might experience varying speeds and occasional connection drops. This is normal and will straighten itself out in a few days once the connection between TalkTalk’s network and your home is stabilised.</p>\n\n[tv_broadband_slow_speeds_cta]\n\n<p>The first thing to try is switching your router off and on again. Try not to do this too often, but it is a common way to fix any problem. If you do it more than once every 24 hours, TalkTalk could flag this as a problem and slow your broadband down to try and fix the issue.</p>\n\n<p>You should also check if you’re having connection issues is your router set-up. Make sure that your router is plugged into the main phone socket rather than an extension socket. The wiring in the extension sockets isn’t built for transmitting broadband signals so won’t work effectively.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re still not sure, you can use the link below to find out why your connection is dropping and how to fix it.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.talktalk.co.uk/help/servicestatus/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out what's wrong</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving house</h2>\n\n<p>Moving house can be stressful, especially when it comes to sorting out all your bills in time. </p>\n\n<p>Luckily, moving house with TalkTalk is really easy. Simply log in to your online account or click the button below to get started.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://myaccount.talktalk.co.uk/homemover/brochure\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move house with TalkTalk</a></center>\n\n<p>You’ll have to contact TalkTalk at least 14 days before your moving date (no more than 3 months before) and tell them:</p>\n<ul><li>Your account number (you can find this on your bills and welcome pack)</li>\n<li>Your current address</li>\n<li>Your new address</li>\n<li>If you want to bring TalkTalk with you to your new home</li></ul>\n\n[tv_broadband_moving_house_cta] \n\n<p>Bear in mind that you might get different download speeds at your new home than you currently get. This is because your speeds are affected by how far you are from the telephone exchange so your new home might be further from its closest one.</p>\n\n<p>When you move, you’ll have to bring all your TalkTalk equipment with you or send it back if you’re switching providers in your new home. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>Having a stable and reliable broadband connection is important in our day-to-day lives. Unfortunately, things can go wrong and you might want to make a complaint.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this by calling 0345 172 0088 or using the TalkTalk live chat service on their website. When customers make complaints on TalkTalk’s Trustpilot page, they’re often directed to their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TalkTalk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TalkTalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> pages which are also helpful.</p>\n\n<p>You can also write to:</p>\n<p>TalkTalk (TTR)<br>\nPO Box 675<br>\nSalford<br>\nM5 0NL</p>\n\n<p>If you write to TalkTalk with your complaint, you’ll have to include:</p>\n<ul><li>Your full name</li>\n<li>Your TalkTalk phone number</li>\n<li>Your signature</li></ul>\n\n<p><b>And</b> one of the following:</p>\n<ul><li>The 3rd and 6th characters of the password you give when talking to Customer Services</li>\n<li>The last 4 digits of the bank account number or the payment card you use to pay your bills</li>\n<li>Your account number</li>\n<li>Your personal security answer provided when you set up your account</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">Switching to TalkTalk</h2>\n\n<p>If TalkTalk broadband is something you might be interested in, you can join TalkTalk by calling 0345 172 0088 or visiting their <a href=\"https://www.talktalk.co.uk/shop/broadband\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re switching from Virgin Media or another FTTP provider, you’ll have to contact them to cancel your contract. They might have to send someone out to disconnect your services so let them know as close to your activation date as possible. If you have broadband from another provider, TalkTalk can cancel your contract for you as part of the switching process.</p>\n\n<p>To sign up for TalkTalk TV, you’ll need to be signed up to TalkTalk broadband as well. When you sign up for broadband, you’ll be given the option of adding TV to your package. It costs just £4 per month to access over 70 standard channels and 15 in HD.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re already with TalkTalk for your broadband, you can add TV to your package through your online account.</p>\n\n<p>To make sure you’re on the right deal for you, give Utility Switchboard a call on...</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"tel:+442030484598\" class=\"btn-phone btn-pink\">020 3048 4598</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancel\">Cancel your TV or broadband package</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re not happy with your TalkTalk broadband or TV package, you might have to cancel your services. </p>\n\n<p>You can do this in a number of ways:</p>\n<ul><li>Calling 0345 172 0046</li>\n<li>Through TalkTalk live chat</li>\n<li>Switching providers</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you cancel within the first 20 days of your order date, you can leave without paying any penalties. This is also the case if you’re 30 days into your fibre broadband package and aren’t happy with your connection.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that if you cancel your TalkTalk broadband package you’ll also lose your TV package.</p>\n\n<h3>Cancellation fees</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to cancel before your broadband contract is up, you might have to pay early cancellation fees.</p>\n\n<p>How much you have to pay depends on which package you’re on and how long is left on your current contract. The table below shows how much you’ll be charged per month:</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Package</th>\n        <th>Cancellation fee per month</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Fast Broadband</td>\n        <td>£10.80</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Fibre broadband</td>\n        <td>£10.20</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Ultra fibre-optic broadband</td>\n        <td>£19.20</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>For example, if you’re currently on a Fibre 35 package with 5 months left on your contract, your cancellation fee would be £10.20 x 5 = £51.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you need to contact TalkTalk about, there are a few different ways you can get in touch.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone</td>\n        <td><a href=\"tel:+443451720088\">0345 172 0088</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Live chat</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/Articles/Our-live-chat-team/ta-p/2230529\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TalkTalk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TalkTalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@TalkTalk</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Community</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/forums/postpage/choose-node/true/category-id/help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/talktalk/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/talktalk/broadband","category":"broadband"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/talktalk/contact","provider":"TalkTalk"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
