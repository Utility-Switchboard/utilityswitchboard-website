You might be able to set up a payment plan or similar.</p>\n\n<p>You can make extra payments through your online account if you miss any.

However, if you’re on a monthly contract, your broadband or TV pass could be shut off.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://account.nowtv.com/payments\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a payment</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’re seeing an error when you try to pay online, there are a few reasons this could be:</p>\n<ul><li>You don’t have enough money in your account</li>\n<li>You’ve entered the wrong security code</li>\n<li>Your card has expired</li>\n<li>Your billing address doesn’t match the address your card is registered to</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"speed\">Check your broadband speed</h2>\n\n<p>If your broadband seems to be slower than it should be, you might want to check your broadband speed to make sure it’s running at the minimum speed you’ve been given.</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple speed test sites available to check this. Simply search ‘broadband speed test’ in your preferred search engine and you’ll have numerous different sites to choose from - Google even has its own speed tester.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can follow these steps:</p>\n<ol><li>Type <b>192.168.0.1</b> into your browser address bar</li>\n<li>When prompted, enter the username <b>admin</b> and the password <b>nowtv</b></li>\n<li>When you’re signed in, select Modem under the Maintenance option</li>\n<li>Your speed will be under ‘DownStream Connection Speed’</li></ol>\n\n<p>In the first 10 days of your contract, you could see some fluctuations in speed as your broadband gets set up. This is normal and should sort itself out.</p>\n\n<h3>Report speed issues</h3>\n\n<p>If, after the first 10 days, your broadband is lower than the minimum speed you were promised when you signed up, you should take a few online checks to test your line and find out if there are any network issues.</p>\n\n<p>This page can also give you tips on how to improve your broadband speed if it finds an easily fixable problem or book an engineer if it’s not.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://account.nowtv.com/check-service-status/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Check service status</a></center>\n\n<p>If this didn’t help you should contact NOW by calling 03330 323 050 or through your online account. If NOW can’t or don’t provide your minimum guaranteed download speed within 30 days, you’ll be able to cancel your broadband package early without paying any cancellation fees.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.nowtv.com/gb/sign-in\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Report speed issues</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"connection-issues\">NOW Broadband connection issues</h2>\n\n<p>The first thing to try if you’re having connection issues is restarting your router. You can do this either by unplugging or switching it off at the wall or using the power button on the router. Leave it off for 30 seconds and turn it back on. Because your router automatically connects to the best channel, this should reconnect it to a new, better one.</p>\n\n[tv_broadband_slow_speeds_cta]\n\n<p>The next thing to try is disconnecting and reconnecting your device. It could be that you’re connected to the wrong network or have entered the wrong password. You should be able to find the right network name and password on your router somewhere (unless you’ve changed it).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, check to see if there are any known faults in the area using the link below. You can also use this page to book an engineer if you need one.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"http://account.nowtv.com/check-service-status/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Check service status</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving house</h2>\n\n<p>Moving house means moving and cancelling all your utilities and memberships. Luckily, it’s really easy to bring NOW Broadband and TV with you when you move.</p>\n\n[tv_broadband_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>The first thing to do is to contact NOW to let them know you’re moving. You can do this by calling 03330 323 050 at least 2 weeks before you move.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to tell them:</p>\n<ul><li>Your current address and phone number</li>\n<li>Your new address</li>\n<li>Your moving date</li></ul>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that your NOW broadband plan might not be available at your new house, however, they’ll check this for you when you contact them. If it's not available in your new home, there are a huge range of different providers that will be. Simply call <a href=\"tel:+442030484598\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">020 3048 4598</a> and we'll help you find the best deal.</p>\n\n<p>You can track your broadband’s move process using the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"http://account.nowtv.com/track-my-order\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Track your move</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re not happy with your NOW TV or broadband package, you might want to make a complaint.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways you can contact NOW TV and Broadband’s complaints team:</p>\n<ul><li>Call 0800 7591213</li>\n<li>Write to NOW Customer Care<br> The Hub<br> 1st Floor<br> Grant Way<br> Isleworth<br> TW7 5QD</li>\n<li>Email customercare@nowtv.com</li>\n<li>Using their <a href=\"https://help.nowtv.com/complaints/bb-calls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">complaints web form</a></li></ul>\n\n<p>You should receive a response and resolution for your complaint within 10 days of you raising the issue if you haven’t been able to reach a resolution over the phone. You’ll be kept updated throughout the process, however, if you’re not happy with how it’s been handled, you can ask the customer service advisor for it to be escalated to management.</p>\n\n<p>Once it's been escalated, you'll be contacted by one of the management team who will further investigate the issue. They'll likely have more resources to resolve the problem to your satisfaction or be able to offer you more compensation.</p>\n\n<p>If you're still not happy after this, you can contact the Communications Ombudsman who will look into your complaint, how it was handled, and if there's another solution. If they find that your provider hasn't taken the right steps, they can come up with an alternative solution. They have the final word and anything they say, goes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancel\">Cancel NOW TV &amp; Broadband</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re looking to cancel your NOW Broadband package, you’ll have to give NOW 14 days notice. Bear in mind that you might have to pay early cancellation fees if you cancel before the end of your contract.</p>\n\n<p>You can cancel your NOW TV and broadband by:</p>\n<ul><li>Calling 0330 041 2479</li>\n<li>Using the live chat service</li>\n<li>Emailing updatemyaccount@nowtv.com</li>\n<li>Switching provider</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can cancel your TV membership through your online account. All you have to do is click ‘Cancel membership’ next to the pass you don’t want anymore and follow the on-screen steps. You’ll be able to keep watching until the date your next payment would be due.</p>\n\n<h3>NOW Broadband cancellation fees</h3>\n\n<p>If you try to cancel your broadband package before the end of your contract (as long as you’re not on a rolling contract), you might have to pay early cancellation fees. </p>\n\n<p>Your cancellation fee will vary depending on:</p>\n<ul><li>How much you pay</li>\n<li>Your broadband package</li>\n<li>How long is left on your contract</li>\n<li>How much NOW save from you leaving early</li></ul>\n\n<p>It will be calculated by taking the monthly charge of your broadband plan and deducting the business costs NOW will save from you leaving early and a discount for paying in a lump sum.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you pay £25 per month for your broadband and have 3 months left on your contract, they will take this £25 and deduct £12.62 for business costs and discounts. This will bring you to £12.38, which will be multiplied by the number of months left on your contract (3) and rounded to the nearest 25p, bringing your cancellation fee to £37.25.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you want to talk about, you can use the methods below to contact NOW about TV and broadband.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone</td> \n        <td>03330 323 050</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td> \n        <td>customerservices@nowtv.com</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n        <td>Online</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://help.nowtv.com/web-form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NOW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@NOW</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nowtv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Write to</td> \n        <td>NOW Customer Care<br> The Hub<br> 1st Floor<br> Grant Way<br> Isleworth<br> TW7 5QD</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/sports","category":"sports"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/tv","category":"tv"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/contact","provider":"NOW Broadband"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
