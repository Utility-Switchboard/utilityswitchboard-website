All of these channels can be watched live with NOW TV and you can also watch your favourite shows and films on-demand if you’ve missed any episodes.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you might not be able to access free-to-air channels in the same place, only the channels you’ve subscribed to -  you’ll have to switch sources if you want more easily accessible channels. However, if you’re watching on a smart TV or a with NOW smart box/stick, you can still watch their catch-up services on the same device.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tv-broadband\">NOW TV and broadband deals</h2>\n\n<p>By opting for NOW broadband on top of your NOW TV passes, you can save money and hassle. </p>\n\n<p>NOW TV and broadband deals offer broadband speeds of up to 63Mbps and by switching to NOW Broadband you could receive discounts of up to 41% on your TV passes.

It’s designed to improve your viewing experience by offering:</p>\n<ul><li>Full HD</li>\n<li>Smoother sports viewing</li>\n<li>Fully immersive audio</li>\n<li>Watching on 2 extra devices</li></ul>\n\n<p>As long as you have an active TV pass, NOW TV Boost will auto-renew at £5 every month unless you cancel it. You can cancel or upgrade your NOW TV Boost membership at any time, just like you would with any other TV pass, through your online account. If you cancel all of your passes, Boost will automatically be cancelled.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://help.nowtv.com/article/what-is-now-boost\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out more about NOW TV Boost</a></center>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that the HD and audio features of NOW TV Boost aren’t available on:</p>\n<ul><li>PC/Mac</li>\n<li>iOS or Android phones and tablets</li>\n<li>Roku devices (except Roku Express or Roku Streaming Stick)</li>\n<li>1st or 2nd generation Chromecast</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.nowtv.com/gb/account/membership\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Upgrade to Boost</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"smart-stick-box\">NOW TV smart stick and box</h3>\n\n<p>While you can watch NOW TV on a range of different devices, NOW TV offers its own branded devices. These come in the form of a smart box and a smart stick.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of what the two do, they’re almost exactly the same - you can use them to turn your regular TV into a smart TV. This allows you to have a range of apps downloaded, including catch-up apps, Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Spotify, and more in one place. </p>\n\n<p>The smart stick plugs straight into the HDMI port at the back of your TV and can even be powered using one of the USB ports, keeping it out of sight. One of the benefits of the stick is that it can easily be plugged into any TV with no installation needed - all you need is a WiFi connection. With its size, this means that you can stream from anywhere, whether that’s on holiday or simply at a friend’s (as long as you’re in the UK).</p>\n\n<p>The smart box is a set-top box that plugs into your HDMI port using an extra cable rather than straight in like the stick. It’s a lot smaller than other set-top boxes so is almost as portable as the NOW TV smart stick. However, it does take longer to set up and has to be plugged into the mains rather than being able to plug it into a USB port. While it also connects through WiFi, there is a port at the back of the box for an ethernet cable to allow for more reliable viewing with lower buffering and load times.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t need an active membership to use either the smart stick or smart box, as long as you’re accessing apps other than NOW TV, such as Netflix, BBC iPlayer, etc. You’ll still need to buy passes if you want to watch any programmes on NOW. You can cancel and restart your membership at any time through your online account.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"parental-controls\">Parental controls</h3>\n\n<p>Like many TV subscription services, you can set a parental pin when watching NOW TV. This helps you control what younger viewers can watch and make sure no one’s watching things they shouldn’t. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there are a few issues with how NOW TV's parental controls work. As there is only a pin to enter, it can be easy for family members to remember the pin, especially as you have to use an on-screen number pad.</p>\n\n<p>Having a parental pin can also trip up those who don’t need to set restrictions as you’ll have to enter the pin if you want to watch certain live cinema and entertainment channels between 5.30am and 9pm. Even if you have parental controls turned off, you’ll still need to enter the pin for these channels.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.nowtv.com/gb/account/settings\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Set up or change parental controls</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">Signing up to NOW TV</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve decided NOW TV is the subscription service for you, it’s really easy to sign up.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is click the button below to find the best TV pass for you or compare deals. </p>\n\n<center><a href=\"http://www.nowtv.com/membership\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up for NOW TV</a></center>\n\n<p>The first time you sign up for a TV pass, you’ll be offered a free trial so you can make sure the pass is for you before you buy it. However, the pass will auto-renew at the end of your trial unless you cancel.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve signed up, you can add and cancel NOW TV passes whenever you like through your online account. If you cancel your pass halfway through the month, you’ll still be able to access all the features of NOW TV until your next bill is due. If you restart your membership, your billing date will change.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tv-license\">Do I need a TV license to watch NOW TV?</h3>\n\n<p>If you watch any of the channels live through your NOW TV membership, you’ll need a TV license. You only need one per household, even if you use more than one device or TV service.</p>\n\n<p>If you only watch shows and films on-demand, you won’t need one. However, you will need to tell TV Licensing that you don’t need a TV license, which you can do <a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/cs/no-licence-needed/index.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need a TV license if you watch live shows and films through any apps on your NOW TV smart box or stick, such as ITV Hub, All4, etc and if you watch BBC iPlayer (even if it’s not live).</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">See if you need a TV license</a></center>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/sports","category":"sports"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/broadband","category":"broadband"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/tv","provider":"NOW Broadband"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
