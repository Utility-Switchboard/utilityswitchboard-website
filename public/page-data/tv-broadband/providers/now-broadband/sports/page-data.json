From this page, you’ll learn everything you need to know about NOW TV Sports and the streaming content they offer. It may be a viable alternative for you and your family if other companies aren’t living up to expectations.</b></p>\n\n\n        <h2 id=\"What\">What is NOW TV Sports?</h2> \n\n        <p>Now TV Sports is part of the overall NOW TV package that’s available as a streaming service that the general public and customers of NOW can gain access to. It’s where the sports channels can be found, and these channels have tons of content available for you to enjoy.</p> \n            \n        <p>NOW was originally developed by Sky and was first founded in 2012, so it’s been up and running as a streaming service for nearly ten years now.</p> \n        <p>Although it was launched by Sky, it’s its own separate entity and isn’t available to watch through any of Sky’s services, such as Sky Go or the Sky Store.</p> \n            \n        <p>This also means that it’s available via the NOW app, and how you can access that app will be covered in more detail further down this page.</p> \n            \n            \n        <h2 id=\"How\">How can I get NOW TV Sports?</h2> \n            \n        <p>Here’s where the NOW TV app comes into play.</p> \n            \n        <p>The NOW TV app is available across almost all platforms: desktop computers, laptops, ipads and phones and other devices.</p> \n            \n        <p>It can also be downloaded as an app for smart tvs on almost all smart tvs, whether they be from Samsung, LG, or Toshiba. It’s an incredibly accessible app!</p> \n            \n        <p>For ipads, iphones, and other Apple devices, you can download NOW TV from the Apple app store.</p> \n            \n        <p>If you’ve got Android devices then you’ll need to head over to Google Play in order to download them for your devices.</p> \n            \n        <p>With smart tvs, they’ll have their own built-in app store where you may be able to download NOW to stream through your tv if it’s compatible.</p>  \n            \n        <p>It’s free to download for every platform, so you don’t need to worry about spending extra money! Save it for your subscriptions!</p> \n            \n            \n        <h3 id=\"Stick\">NOW TV Stick</h3> \n            \n        <p>Another way you can gain access to sports and movies and everything else NOW has to offer is through the NOW TV stick.</p> \n            \n        <p>They work in a similar way to an Amazon Firestick, except this one is specifically geared towards NOW’s content. Having said that, you can still get extra streaming platforms through these sticks, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and BBC iPlayer.</p> \n            \n        <p>These sticks are available to buy for £25, and they’re a handy way of being able to watch the content you want either at home or on holiday if you can connect to a hotel’s Wi-Fi.</p> \n        <p>With a NOW TV Stick, you can also use voice control instead of using the buttons on the remote in order to bring up the sports you want to watch.</p> \n            \n        <p>The price of the NOW TV Stick DOESN’T include a subscription fee for you to be able to watch Sky Sports on that device. You’ll have to pay for your subscription on top of the price of a NOW TV Stick.</p> \n            \n            \n        <h2 id=\"Included\">What’s included with NOW TV Sports</h2> \n            \n            \n        <p>Because NOW was first created by Sky, the sports they show are in direct partnership with Sky Sports, meaning that you don’t have to pay for a Sky subscription or wait for a TV box to be delivered to your home: you can just subscribe to Sky Sports through NOW TV sports.</p> \n            \n        <p>Everything that is part of a Sky Sports’ package will be available to you through a NOW TV sports pass. This means that you’ll have access to all 11 of Sky Sports channels, from Sky Sports Premier League to Sky Sports Formula 1.</p> \n            \n        <p>Here’s a list of sports channels available to you after you sign up:</p> \n            \n        <ul><li>Sky Sports Main Event</li> \n        <li>Sky Sports Premier League</li> \n        <li>Sky Sports Football</li> \n        <li>Sky Sports Cricket</li> \n        <li>Sky Sports Golf</li>\n        <li>Sky Sports Formula 1</li> \n        <li>Sky Sports Action</li> \n        <li>Sky Sports Arena</li> \n        <li>Sky Sports Racing</li>\n        <li>Sky Sports Mix</li> \n        <li>Sky Sports News</li></ul> \n            \n        <p>You’ll only be able to watch Sky Sports on one device at any one time, so make sure you and your family agree on what sport to watch. From football to cricket, to Netball to Darts, there’s plenty to choose from if you sign up to NOW TV Sports.</p> \n            \n        <h2 id=\"Cost\">How much does NOW TV Sports cost?</h2> \n            \n        <p>NOW TV Sports has two different costs attached to its membership, and the price of it all depends on what membership you decide to go for.</p> \n            \n        <p>For starters, there’s the Sports Membership plus a NOW Boost trial.</p> \n            \n        <p>This includes:</p> \n            \n        <ul><li>A 7-day free trial with NOW Boost. Once those 7 days are up, it’ll cost £5 a month to continue using NOW Boost.</li> \n        <li>Access to all of the Sky Sports channels mentioned above.</li> \n        <li>The ability to watch this sporting content on any of your devices and on the go.</li> \n        <li>This membership also gives you access to sports highlights and documentaries that you can catch up on whenever you like.</li></ul> \n            \n        <p>The Sports Membership is priced at £33.99 per month. Whilst this is more expensive than the sports packages that Sky sell through themselves, you don’t have to have Sky Signature in place if you watch through NOW, whereas this would be compulsory through Sky, and cost an extra £26 per month.</p> \n            \n        <p>The second package available to buy is the Sports Day + Mobile Month Membership.</p> \n            \n        <p>This includes access to the 11 Sky Sports channels for the day. In addition, you can get an 8-month mobile membership for your mobile phone, which will give you access to five Sky Sports on your smartphone, and you’ll receive these within 10 working days of signing up for NOW TV Sports.</p> \n            \n        <p>The Sports day pass is priced at £9.98 as a one-off payment.</p> \n            \n            \n        <h2 id=\"Devices\">What devices can you get NOW TV Sports on?</h2> \n            \n        <p>The great thing about NOW is that it’s compatible with a lot of devices, so you can watch NOW TV Sports on almost anything.</p> \n            \n        <p>Such as:</p> \n            \n        <ul><li>Smart TVs - such as LGs, Samsungs, Toshibas, and Sony.</li> \n        <li>Portable sticks - NOW TV Sticks and Amazon Firesticks.</li> \n        <li>On Android Devices - 5s or later.</li> \n        <li>On iPhones - Version 5 or later.</li> \n        <li>iPad 5th generation or later, iPad Airs and iPad Mini 2s.</li> \n        <li>iOS 13 devices or later. NOW TV no longer works properly on devices with iOS 11 or 12 installed.</li> \n        <li>Computers and Laptops. Not compatible with MacBooks.</li> \n        <li>Gaming Consoles - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Playstation 4 and Playstation 5.</li></ul> \n            \n            \n        <h2 id=\"Cancel\">How to cancel NOW TV Sports</h2> \n            \n        <p>In order to cancel NOW TV Sports, you’ll have to have access to your computer or laptop, as you cannot cancel your membership through the app.</p> \n            \n        <p>You can’t cancel your subscription through the NOW TV stick or the Amazon Firesticks either.</p> \n            \n        <p>To cancel NOW TV Sports, you’ll have to log into your NOW account on NOWtv.com, sign in, and then head to My Account, and then into the Manage Account section.</p> \n            \n        <p>Once you’ve cancelled, NOW should send you a confirmation email confirming your cancelled subscription within three hours of you doing so.</p> \n            \n        <p>If you're a NOW customer through either BT or iTunes, then cancelling NOW becomes a bit more complicated as you’ll have to cancel your subscription directly through BT or iTunes.</p>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/tv","category":"tv"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/sports","provider":"NOW Broadband"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
