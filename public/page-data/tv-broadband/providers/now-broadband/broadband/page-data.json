You’ll receive these discounts for the length of your contract or 12 months if you’re on a rolling contract.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th></th>\n        <th>Entertainment</th>\n        <th>Cinema</th>\n        <th>Sports</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Discounted price</td>\n        <td>£5.99</td>\n        <td>£6.99</td>\n        <td>£19.99</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Normal price</td>\n        <td>£9.99</td>\n        <td>£9.99</td>\n        <td>£33.99</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Saving</td>\n        <td>40%</td>\n        <td>30%</td>\n        <td>41%</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<center><a href=\"../tv/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Find out more about NOW TV passes</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"add-ons\">Add-ons and extras</h2>\n\n<p>Once you’ve chosen your NOW Broadband package, there are a huge number of extras you can add to make the most of your broadband package and usage.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rolling-contracts\">Rolling contracts</h3>\n\n<p>All NOW broadband deals are available as a 12-month contract or a 30-day rolling contract, depending on what suits you best. This means that you won’t be locked into a contract, adding a lot more flexibility to your broadband package. You’re free to switch, upgrade, and cancel your broadband whenever you like with no extra fees.</p>\n\n<p>If you opt for one of the NOW TV and broadband deals on a rolling contract and cancel in less than 12 months, you’ll only receive the discount while you’re a NOW broadband member. However, the TV pass will go back to its standard price if you’re still a member after 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that if you choose the 30-day rolling contract option, you’ll have to pay an upfront fee of £60 plus £5 for router and equipment delivery.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"broadband-buddy\">NOW Broadband Buddy</h3>\n\n<p>NOW Broadband Buddy is a free parental control software that helps keep you and your family safe from online threats and inappropriate content.</p>\n\n<p>You can use it on any device connected to your network and lets you:</p>\n<ul><li>&gt;Control which websites devices on your network can access</li>\n<li>Protect your devices from phishing and malware-infected websites</li>\n<li>Automatically change the age rating at a specific time each day</li></ul>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, unlike other parental control software, you can only set one restriction across all devices on your network.

This allows the broadband to reach your home from the cabinet. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll be given the Pay as you use option as standard with the cost of line rental included in your plan, however, you can upgrade to different inclusive call packages if you use your landline regularly.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Plan</th>\n        <th>Price per month</th>\n        <th>Features</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Pay as you use</td>\n        <td>£0</td>\n        <td><ul><li>Only pay for the minutes you use</li>\n            <li>Ideal if you don’t make calls often</li>\n            <li>20p per minute to UK mobiles and landlines</li></ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Evening and weekend calls</td>\n        <td>£4</td>\n        <td><ul><li>Unlimited calls to UK numbers 7-7 and weekends</li>\n                <li>Minutes over 1 hour will be charged</li></ul></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Anytime calls</td>\n        <td>£8</td>\n        <td><ul><li>Unlimited calls to UK numbers 24/7</li>\n            <li>Discounted international calls</li></ul></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>NOW call services also have their own extras to choose from, including:</p>\n<ul><li>Auto number withholding</li>\n<li>Anonymous caller reject</li>\n<li>Voicemail</li>\n<li>Last caller barring</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://account.nowtv.com/my-package/phone-extras/change\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Upgrade your call plan</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">Switching to NOW Broadband</h2>\n\n<p>Switching to NOW Broadband is a quick and easy process.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do to compare NOW Broadband deals is click the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.nowtv.com/broadband-deals\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Compare broadband deals</a></center>\n\n<p>When it comes to cancelling your current broadband package, NOW should be able to do it for you when you switch. They’ll work with your current provider to make the switch as easy as possible and avoid any disruptions to your service.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re switching before the end of your contract, you might have to pay early cancellation fees to your old provider. These are worked out differently depending on your provider, package, and contract so it might be worth checking before you switch.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re switching from Virgin Media or another FTTP package, you’ll have to contact them to cancel your contract yourself. Let them know your NOW Broadband activation date so they can cancel your services as close to the activation date as possible to avoid disruptions. You can check your activation date through your NOW online account.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://account.nowtv.com/track-my-order\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find your activation date</a></center>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/sports","category":"sports"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/tv","category":"tv"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/broadband","provider":"NOW Broadband"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
