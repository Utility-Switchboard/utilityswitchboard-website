As always, we’ve got you covered.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"features\">What can you do through your BT account?</h2>\n\n<p>Your online account is a great way to take control of your broadband, TV, and mobile packages.</p>\n\n<p>With a BT account, you can:</p>\n<ul><li>View and download bills (paper bills cost £3 each!)</li>\n<li>Change your contact details</li>\n<li>Change your direct debit</li>\n<li>Change your TV, Broadband, or phone package</li>\n<li>Move your services to a new house</li>\n<li>Set up and use BT Extras</li>\n<li>Download the My BT app</li>\n<li> your WiFi name and password</li>\n<li>Save files to the BT Cloud</li>\n<li>Track your orders and repairs</li>\n<li>Test your broadband speed</li>\n<li>Quickly and easily contact BT</li>\n<li>Connect to BT WiFi hotspots</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"setup\">How to set up a My BT account</h2>\n\n<p>There are two ways you can set up an online account: as an account holder or account manager.</p>\n\n<p>The account holder should be the person who pays the bills. They will be the legal owner of the account and can use all services and changes available, as well as closing the account.</p>\n\n<p>To set up an account holder, you will need:</p>\n<ul><li>Your 10 character account number</li>\n<li>Your name</li>\n<li>Your date of birth</li></ul>\n\n<p>The account manager is for those who want to manage someone else’s account for them. They can’t access all the services available to the account holder, but they can view bills, manage settings online, and manage phone settings. They’re not the legal owner and can’t close the account.</p>\n\n<p>To set up an account manager, you will only need the account number.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t have or don’t know your account number, you can also use your BT phone number and postcode.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.bt.com/s/apps/appsselfserve/index.html#/createbtid\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Create a BT ID</a></center>\n \n\n<h2 id=\"login-page\">Where can you find the BT broadband login page?</h2>\n\n<p>You can access the login page from anywhere on the BT website. Simply click ‘My BT’ in the top corner.</p>\n\n<p>When you hover over ‘My BT’, some helpful links will come up that can take you to different areas of your account depending on what you want to do.</p>\n\n<p>These are the most common actions people take in their online accounts, however, you can access many more features if you click ‘Log in’ or by clicking the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://home.bt.com/login/loginform\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign into your BT account</a></center>\n \n<h2 id=\"login-details\">How to find your BT broadband login details</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll need a BT ID and password to access all of BT’s online services, whether that’s My BT, BT Cloud, or BT Sports.</p>\n\n<p>But where do you find your BT broadband login details if you’ve forgotten them?</p>\n\n<h3>Help with your username</h3>\n\n<p>Your BT ID username will likely be the email address you used to sign up for your BT broadband, TV, or phone package. This will be where you get your correspondence from BT. If you have an older account, you may have set up your own username.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve forgotten your username, you can use your BT landline number or account number instead. You’ll find your account number on your bills and any correspondence you get from BT. It will be 10 characters long - starting with 2 letters followed by 8 numbers.</p>\n\n<p>If you still can’t remember your username, you should contact BT either by <a href=\"https://z2.liveper.sn/api/account/55195536/route/campaign/1411944750/engagement/1411945250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live chat</a> or by calling 0800 800 150.</p>\n\n<h3>Help with your password</h3>\n\n<p>While it may sound simple, the first thing you should do if you’re having trouble with your password is to check you’re using the right username and password combination for your BT broadband login. Then, make sure that there are no spelling mistakes - try deleting your password from the field and re-entering it.</p>\n\n<p>If you still need help with your BT ID password, you can follow the steps below to reset your password:</p>\n<ul><li>Enter your BT ID in the ‘Forgotten your login details’ form</li>\n<li>Select ‘Reset Password’</li>\n<li>Click ‘Get PIN Code’</li>\n<li>Enter the PIN to reset your password</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.bt.com/s/apps/appsselfserve/index.html#/forgotPassword\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Reset your password</a></center>\n \n<p>If you have trouble remembering passwords, all BT customers have access to McAfee’s True Key Password Manager for free. True Key auto-saves and even enters all of your passwords so you don’t have to worry about remembering them!</p>\n\n<p>Your passwords are stored locally on your device and synced across allowed devices using the strongest encryption available. When you launch an app or visit a website, True Key automatically fills your passwords and signs in for you.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.truekey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out more about True Key</a></center>\n \n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the My BT app</h2>\n\n<p>Accessing and managing your BT account has never been easier. You can now do almost everything through the My BT app.</p>\n\n<p>Through the app, you can:</p>\n<ul><li>View your landline and mobile usage</li>\n<li>View and pay bills</li>\n<li>Change your details</li>\n<li>Check service status and network faults in your area</li>\n<li>Track your orders</li>\n<li>Set up your Smart Hub and Complete WiFi</li>\n<li>Run a speed test</li>\n<li>Change and upgrade your broadband and TV packages</li>\n<li>Contact BT</li>\n<li>Set usage limits</li></ul>\n\n<p>The app is available on the App Store for devices on iOS 10 and above, and Google Play for devices Android 6.0 and up.</p>\n\n<div class=\"app-store-double\">\n    <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/my-bt/id979618672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/6tIOkBxFcLxfaYYwZG3ZRB/e1fc27b6d3e34a179640a88548bd5d2e/download-app-store.png\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bt.btserviceapp&amp;hl=en_GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/7hmRcicCQzLoZWs5oJZ7Mx/d1ec589bffb6a56079ac155a701b0cc7/download-google-play.png\"></a>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you already have an online account, you can sign into the My BT app with the same BT broadband login details.

By receiving your bills through the post, you’re paying an extra £3 per bill to cover the costs. However, with an online account, you can view, download, and print your bills for free whenever you like.</p>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/box","category":"box"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/moving-home","category":"moving-home"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/bt-sport","category":"bt-sport"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/app","category":"app"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/cancel","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/halo","category":"halo"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/guide","category":"guide"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/login","provider":"BT"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
