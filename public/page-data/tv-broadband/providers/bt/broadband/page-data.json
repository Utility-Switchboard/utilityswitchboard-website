BT broadband and TV deals include fibre broadband and flexible TV plans which you can change every month. Unfortunately, you can’t get BT TV without BT broadband but, with up to 189 channels available, it’s a great addition if you’re planning on getting broadband already.</p>\n\n<p>The entertainment bundles come with Freeview and AMC which you can browse, stream and download on your new recordable TV box. This package also includes a NOW TV Entertainment pass, which allows you to access Sky and other premium entertainment channels both live and on-demand. With the right package, you can also access Sky Cinema channels with NOW TV, also live and on-demand.</p>\n\n<p>The sports bundles come with 4 BT-only sports channels which show exclusive games and matches, BoxNation for extra boxing matches, and now comes with Eurosport 1 and 2. You’ll receive Freeview, AMC, and a recordable TV box to watch them all on. On top of this, you can also access 11 Sky Sports channels thanks to NOW TV.</p>\n\n<p>The VIP bundle comes with everything you could want: entertainment, sports, fibre broadband, NOW TV memberships and HD shows and movies from both Sky and BT channels.</p>\n\n<p>You can add and remove subscriptions such as Netflix and NOW TV every month through your My BT account whenever you like to create a BT broadband and TV bundle that suits you.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../tv/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">See what BT TV has to offer</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"add-ons\">Add-ons</h2>\n\n<p>One of the best ways to make the most of your BT broadband is to pair it with a few add-ons. Whether that’s TV, mobile, or just some extra perks, all you need is your BT ID and you can get all kinds of add-ons.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"complete-wifi\">BT Complete Wi-Fi</h3>\n\n<p>BT Complete WiFi can be added to any fibre package to ensure reliable WiFi in every room of the house. With BT Complete WiFi, you’ll be sent the latest broadband router along with a WiFi disc to put in another room to create a seamless network throughout the house.</p>\n\n<p>When you sign up for BT Complete WiFi, you can use the My BT app to work out where’s best to put your WiFi disc and check the signal strength in each room. Your devices will connect to whichever is strongest to get the best signal possible.</p>\n\n<p>If one disc doesn’t reach every room, you’ll be sent additional discs and could receive £100 back.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.bt.com/broadband/complete-wifi\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Upgrade to Complete WiFi</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"call-protect\">BT Call Protect</h3>\n\n<p>Your landline service comes free with your BT broadband, and with this comes BT Call Protect. Call Protect helps protect you from unwanted calls set up both automatically and manually.</p>\n\n<p>BT blacklist automatically diverts nuisance callers to a junk voicemail if they’re known to be unwanted calls. You can also set up your own personal blacklist and choose specific numbers or categories (for example, international or unrecognised) to block and divert as well. You can access these voicemails through your phone’s main menu.</p>\n\n<p>You can also set ‘Do Not Disturb’ times where ALL calls will be diverted to your personal voicemail (which you can access by calling 1572). Any VIP contacts you set up will still be able to get through and blacklisted calls will still be sent to your junk voicemail.</p>\n\n<p>You can manage these settings through your My BT online account or by calling 1572 from your landline.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"virus-protect\">Web and Virus Protect</h3>\n\n<p>All BT broadband packages come with free web and virus protection included.</p>\n\n<p>BT Web Protect will protect all devices connected to your home network or using your BT ID at BT Wi-Fi Hotspots. It can help prevent viruses, scams, and phishing attacks by warning you about potentially harmful web pages. It can even help protect you from the most common attacks: clicking bad links in emails.</p>\n\n<p>If you know a site is safe, you can override Web Protect and continue to visit the site, but it serves as a reminder to be careful online.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.bt.com/appsconsumeraccount/secure/btquickactivation\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Activate Web Protect</a></center>\n\n<p>BT Virus Protect gives you extra protection as it works with security experts McAfee Intel Security. It gives you more advanced security on your devices that have Virus Protect installed from viruses, spyware, scams, phishing, and other potential infections, not just online but also from external sources such as USB sticks.</p>\n\n<p>Virus Protect keeps your device safe wherever you are. You can install it on up to 15 Windows, iOS, and Android devices to keep all your devices virus-free, no matter where it’s connected to, BT or not.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.bt.com/npp/manage\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Activate Virus Protect</a></center>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/box","category":"box"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/moving-home","category":"moving-home"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/bt-sport","category":"bt-sport"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/app","category":"app"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/cancel","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/halo","category":"halo"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/guide","category":"guide"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/broadband","provider":"BT"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
