With so many added features to think about, you can use this page to learn everything you need to know about the new BT Halo 3 and 3+. As always, we’ve got you covered.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is BT Halo?</h2>\n\n<p>BT Halo is the newest premium plan from BT Broadband. It offers extra features and support for customers to improve broadband connections across the country by combining home broadband and mobile data to ensure customers receive ‘unbreakable’ and reliable wi-fi.</p>\n\n<p>Christian Thrane, Managing Director of Marketing at BT, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>With BT Halo 3+, we’re launching an innovative new category of home broadband that’s truly a first of its kind in the UK. We are combining the best fibre home broadband and wi-fi technology, backed up with our award-winning EE mobile network to become the only UK provider that offers customers an unbreakable wi-fi connection in the home.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both new and existing customers can switch to BT Halo 3 and 3+ by calling 0800 800 150 or by getting a quote <a href=\"https://www.bt.com/broadband/halo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online</a>.</p> \n\n<h2 id=\"features\">What’s included in BT Halo?</h2>\n\n<p>There are two Halo plans at the moment: BT Halo 3 and the upgraded BT Halo 3+. Both plans come with a range of features you wouldn’t get on a normal BT broadband plan, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Home Tech Experts</b> - Tech experts will come to your house to make repairs or make sure your connection is perfectly set up. They’re available 7 days a week where you can book a two-hour slot for their visit and they’ll also come round once a year to check everything’s working as it should.</li>\n<li><b>Keep Connected Promise</b> - If you’re having broadband issues or are moving home, you’ll be sent a 4G mini-hub to keep you connected at all times. Alongside your mini-hub, your BT mobiles will receive unlimited mobile data until you’re back up and running completely.</li>\n<li><b>Price Promise</b> - You’ll never pay more than a new customer when you renew your contract with BT. </li>\n<li><b>Double mobile data</b> - If you upgrade to BT Halo, you’ll receive double data on your BT mobile for the duration of your broadband contract</li>\n<li><b>Stay Fast Guarantee</b> - If your speeds fall below your minimum guaranteed speeds given when you sign up for 30 days or more, you’ll receive money back on your bill.</li>\n<li><b>Full Fibre Promise</b> - You’ll get a free upgrade to Full Fibre 100 when it’s available in your area.</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-vs-3-plus\">What’s the difference between BT Halo 3 and BT Halo 3+?</h2>\n\n<p>Both plans come with great features, but Halo 3+ is essentially an upgraded version of BT Halo 3. It comes with an array of extra features, which you can see in the table below.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th><center>Halo 3</center></th>\n        <th><center>Halo 3+</center></th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><ul><li>Home tech experts</li>\n        <li>Keep Connected promise</li>\n        <li>Price promise</li>\n        <li>Double mobile data</li>\n        <li>Stay Fast Guarantee</li>\n        <li>Full Fibre promise</li></ul></td>\n        <td><ul><li>Home tech experts</li>\n        <li>Keep Connected promise</li>\n        <li>Price promise</li>\n        <li>Double mobile data</li>\n        <li>Stay Fast Guarantee</li>\n        <li>Full Fibre promise</li>\n        <li>BT Hybrid Connect</li>\n        <li>Complete WiFi</li>\n        <li>Smart Hub 2</li></ul></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>What happened to BT Halo 1 and BT Halo 2?</h3>\n\n<p>BT Halo didn’t go straight to Halo 3 - there was Halo 1 and 2 before it.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, they’re no longer available to new customers, but existing BT Halo customers who are on the older models will still receive the same benefits throughout their contract.</p>\n\n<p>Customers on Halo 1 and 2 packages can upgrade to BT Halo 3 by contacting BT or upgrading through your online account. While it may increase your broadband bills, you’ll now receive so many more features than you could on other Halo plans.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hybrid-connect\">BT Hybrid Connect</h2>\n\n<p>BT Hybrid Connect is a new service from BT which combines a fibre broadband service with a 4G or 5G connection from EE. If your fibre broadband has a fault, the Hybrid Connect backup will automatically kick in and connect you to the mobile data network instead.</p>\n\n<p>BT Hybrid Connect comes as standard with the BT Halo 3+ package, however, you can add it to any BT broadband package for just £7 extra per month.</p>\n\n<p>Hybrid Connect comes with:</p>\n<ul><li>Unbreakable WiFi</li>\n<li>BT Complete WiFi</li>\n<li>4G coverage from EE</li>\n<li>Next-day online connection (if you’re switching or moving house)</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Will I notice a difference when BT Hybrid Connect switches between networks?</h3>\n\n<p>You might not notice that your connection has been switched to the mobile network.</p>\n\n<p>The Hybrid Connect will kick in automatically if it detects a fault with your broadband connection. It works seamlessly with your Smart Hub 2 and takes just 90 seconds to start working.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no need to reconnect any of your devices as the 4G backup works with your Smart Hub 2, which you’ll already be connected to. You’ll also still be able to use other features that come with your BT Halo plan, such as Complete WiFi to make sure you have a strong connection in every room, even on the mobile connection.</p>\n\n<p>However, the speeds you’ll get when connected to Hybrid Connect will be around 30Mbps, which may be significantly lower than your package would normally be. So you might notice your broadband slowing down, but hopefully, it shouldn’t be for long.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I know if I’m using Hybrid Connect?</h3>\n\n<p>To find out if you’re connected to Hybrid Connect, you should look at the lights on both your Smart Hub and the signal bars on your Hybrid Connect.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re using 4G, the light on your hub will turn purple and the signal bars on your Hybrid Connect will turn white.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re using it regularly, you might want to <a href=\"../contact\"><b>contact BT</b></a> by calling 0800 800 150 to find out what’s wrong with your connection and if it can be fixed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complete-wifi\">BT Complete WiFi</h2>\n\n<p>Complete WiFi uses WiFi discs to extend the signal from your Smart Hub 2 to make sure every corner of your house has access to the internet. It’s an amazing solution if you have poor or no wifi in certain rooms.</p>\n\n<p>When your Smart Hub 2 is delivered or you upgrade to BT Complete WiFi, you’ll be sent one free wifi disc, but you can request up to two more for free if that still leaves rooms with a bad connection. Ou can do this through the BT <a href=\"https://support.bt.com/fix/broadband/?view=broadbandtroubleshooter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online troubleshooter</a> or by calling 0800 800 150.</p>\n\n<h3>How to set up your Complete WiFi disc(s)</h3>\n\n<p>You can use the My BT app to set up your new WiFi discs.</p>\n\n<ol><li>Once you’re signed in, click <b>‘More’</b> on the homepage. Under ‘Your WiFi Network, there will be the option to <b>‘Set up a new disc’</b>.</li>\n<li>Plug your disc into the mains using the power cable.</li>\n<li>Plug one end of the ethernet cable that came with your disc into the socket on the back of the disc (it’s labelled ‘ethernet’) and the other end into one of the <b><span style=\"color:#F4FF00\">yellow</span></b> ports on the back of your router.</li>\n<li>After 3 minutes, when the light on your disc has turned solid <b><span style=\"color:#2941B2\">blue</span></b>, unplug the ethernet and power cables.</li>\n<li>The BT app will now ask about the size and layout of your house and tell you the best place to put your wifi disc to make the most of your BT Complete WiFi.</li>\n<li>Plug it into the mains where the BT app suggests the WiFi disc will be most effective or in your preferred location.</li>\n<li>After 2 minutes, the light will turn either <b><span style=\"color:#2941B2\">blue</span></b> or <b><span style=\"color:#ED9611\">orange</span></b>. You can then name your disc through the app and you’re ready to go.</li></ol>\n\n<div class=\"app-store-double\">\n    <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/my-bt/id979618672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/6tIOkBxFcLxfaYYwZG3ZRB/e1fc27b6d3e34a179640a88548bd5d2e/download-app-store.png\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bt.btserviceapp&hl=en_GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/7hmRcicCQzLoZWs5oJZ7Mx/d1ec589bffb6a56079ac155a701b0cc7/download-google-play.png\"></a>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"price\">How much does BT Halo cost?</h2>\n\n<p>Depending on your current package, you can upgrade to BT Halo from just £1 extra per month. </p>\n\n<p>There are a few different BT Halo packages available:</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th></th>\n        <th>Fibre and BT Halo 3+</th>\n        <th>Fibre 100 and BT Halo 3+</th>\n        <th>Fibre 300 and BT Halo 3+</th>\n        <th>Fibre 900 and BT Halo 3+</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Speed</td>\n        <td>70Mbps</td>\n        <td>145Mbps</td>\n        <td>300Mbps</td>\n        <td>900Mbps</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Contract length</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Set-up fees</td>\n        <td>£9.99</td>\n        <td>£9.99</td>\n        <td>£9.99</td>\n        <td>£9.99</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Price per month</td>\n        <td>£70.99</td>\n        <td>£74.99</td>\n        <td>£79.99</td>\n        <td>£85.99</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>To make sure you’re on the right broadband package for you, give Utility Switchboard a call on...</p>\n\n<center><a href='tel:+442030484598' class='btn-phone btn-pink'>020 3048 4598</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">How to switch to BT Halo</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re already a BT broadband customer, you can upgrade to BT Halo through your online account or by calling 0800 800 150.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re planning on switching to BT broadband and want to add BT Halo to your package, you can switch either <a href=\"https://www.bt.com/broadband/halo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online</a> or by calling 0800 800 150.</p>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/box","category":"box"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/moving-home","category":"moving-home"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/bt-sport","category":"bt-sport"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/app","category":"app"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/cancel","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/guide","category":"guide"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/halo","provider":"BT"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
