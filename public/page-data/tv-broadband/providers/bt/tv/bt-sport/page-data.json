Despite this, people may be wondering how BT Sports is different to its competitors in terms of price and what it has to offer. This page will aim to help answer those questions and queries you may be having about BT Sports and the BT Sports pass.</b></p> \n\n<h2 id=\"Why\"> Why BT Sports?</h2> \n\n<p>A big question and the forefront of every new customers’ mind will be why choose BT Sports? What does it have to offer?</p> \n\n<p>To put it simply, BT Sports is one of the biggest platforms in the UK where you can watch hours and hours of live sport, broadcast from here in the UK and elsewhere around the world. It was first launched in 2013, and it has grown and grown ever since.</p> \n\n<p>Although other companies such as Sky may have a greater quantity of sports channels available at their disposal, there is an argument to say that BT Sports has a greater variety of sports in terms of the sport they broadcast domestically from the UK and international sport, such as Australian Rules Football and UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship).</p> \n\n<p>In terms of the world’s biggest sport, Football, BT Sports has exclusive rights to the biggest European competitions, including the Champions League and Europa League.</p> \n\n<p>You can also view all of BT Sport’s content in Ultra HD.</p> \n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Watch\">What can you watch on BT Sports?</h2>\n\n<p>There’s a number of high profile international sports you can watch on BT Sport. Here’s some of the content that’s available to you.</p> \n\n<ul>\n<li>Live Premier League games</li>\n<li>Domestic cup competitions such as the FA Cup</li>\n<li>European football from the French and Italian leagues</li> \n<li>European cup competitions such as the Champions League, Europa League, and Europa Conference League.</li> \n<li>Cricket - UK games from The Hundred, Australia T20 games from the Big Bash League.</li> \n<li>WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment</li> \n<li>UFC - Ultimate Fighting Championship</li> \n<li>Premiership Rugby Union</li> \n<li>Rugby - European Champions Cup</li>\n<li>Rugby - European Challenge Cup</li> \n<li>Boxing</li> \n<li>MotoGP</li> \n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"How-Much\">How much is BT Sports?</h2> \n\n<p>How much BT Sports costs depends on what package you decide to purchase from BT. There are multiple options for you to choose from.</p> \n\n<p><b>BT TV Sport</b> - With this deal, all of the BT Sports channels are included, as is the channel BoxNation. You can gain instant access to the BT Sport app and have the opportunity to change this package monthly if you want to upgrade it. The BT TV Sport package is priced at £15 a month on a 24-month contract, with a £29.99 upfront charge.</p> \n\n<p><b>BT TV Big Sport</b> - Includes all of BT Sports and BoxNation but on top of this, all 11 of Sky Sports’ channels are sports channels you can also access via a NOW Sports membership, which means you can watch sports such as Formula 1 and The Ryder Cup. This deal is one of BT’s most expensive, coming in at £40 a month on a 24-month contract, with a £29.99 upfront charge.</p> \n\n<p>You can also purchase BT Sport via other TV platforms such as Sky TV and TalkTalk TV, but their prices will differ from those provided by BT.</p> \n\n<p>You can contact Utility Switchboard at 0203 048 4598 and we’ll be able to give you advice on what would be the best deal including BT Sports for you to take up, based on your tv box and broadband supplier.</p> \n\n<center><a href=\"tel:+442030484598\" class=\"btn-phone btn-pink\">020 3048 4598</a></center>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"BT-Sport-Monthly-Pass\">What’s the BT Sport Monthly-pass?</h2> \n\n<p>There’s another way in which you can watch your favourite sports on BT Sports, without the need to sign up.</p> \n\n<p>With the BT Sport monthly pass, you’re granted a 30-day access period to BT Sports. This means you can watch every live sport on every BT channel straight away, without the need for BT broadband.</p> \n\n<p>You can also cancel this deal at any time. This monthly pass is priced at £25 a month on a rolling contract, and there’s no upfront charge.</p> \n\n<p>You can use this pass on a maximum of two devices simultaneously.</p>  \n\n<p>Because this pass works on a monthly rolling contract, it will renew itself at the start of every month, meaning that it won’t cancel automatically after your first month of using it has come to an end. It will restart, and you have to cancel it yourself.</p> \n\n<p>If you do cancel it within your 30-day viewing period, you can still watch all the content BT Sports provides until that 30 day viewing period expires.</p> \n\n<p>The monthly pass gives customers access to every BT Sports channel, so that would be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BT Sports 1</li>\n<li>BT Sports 2</li>\n<li>BT Sports 3</li>\n<li>BT Sports ESPN</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Plus, live events that are broadcast on BT Sport Ultimate and BT Sport Extra</b></p> \n\n<p>There’s also channels such as BT Sport Box Office where you can watch prime sporting events such as big boxing clashes like Fury V Wilder, and pay-per-views from UFC.</p> \n\n<p>Unfortunately, you’ll need to pay for these live sporting events, even if you’re already a subscribing BT customer. The prices will vary depending on the sport in question.</p> \n\n<h2 id=\"Day-Pass\">Can you get a BT sport day pass?</h2>\n\n<p>There is no BT Sport day pass available from BT. The lowest sports package BT offers is their monthly pass. NOW don’t offer a day pass for watching BT Sport either.</p> \n\n\n<h3 id=\"How-to-get\">How can you get the BT Sport pass?</h3> \n\n<p>Please note that you can only watch sporting content on BT Sport via the BT Sport app. You’re not able to watch anything through your Sky Box, Virgin Media box, or any other television setup you have. It needs to be through the BT Sport app, which is available to download on both the Apple App Store and Android’s Google Play Store.</p> \n \n<div class=\"app-store-double\">\n    <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/bt-sport/id669428471\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/6tIOkBxFcLxfaYYwZG3ZRB/e1fc27b6d3e34a179640a88548bd5d2e/download-app-store.png\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bt.btsport&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/7hmRcicCQzLoZWs5oJZ7Mx/d1ec589bffb6a56079ac155a701b0cc7/download-google-play.png\"></a>\n</div>\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can download the BT Sports pass from the BT website when searching for information on the Monthly Pass on their website. \n\n <center><a href=\"https://www.bt.com/sport/tv\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download BT Sport</a></center>\n\n\n<p> If paying for the pass via BT’s website, you’ll be asked to put in either your credit or debit card details. You’ll be asked to set up a BT ID during your order. Once this has been created, this is what you’ll need to use every time you sign in again on BT Sports’ app or online player.</p> \n\n<p>Once you’ve ordered your BT Sports pass and downloaded the app onto the device you want to watch the sports on, you’ll be able to watch the sport you want within 15 minutes of purchasing your content.</p> \n\n<p>If you’re an EE customer, you can get access to the BT sports app, and therefore the BT sports pass, through your EE account. This costs less that the BT Sports Monthly Pass, only costing the EE customer £20 a month, where you’re able to watch the app through multiple devices and on a larger screen if you so wish.</p> \n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Broadband\">Do you need BT broadband to get the BT Sports Monthly pass?</h2> \n\n\n<p>No, you can get the BT sports pass without having a BT broadband connection set up in your house.</p> \n\n<p><b>ONLY</b> if you bought one of BT’s sports packages with a fixed contract price and period would you need to have a BT broadband package in place.</p> \n\n<p>Having said this, you’ll still need a BT ID in order to access the monthly pass on the BT Sports app, because your username and password or your Touch ID will be how you log into the app!</p>\n\n<p>If you need help in creating a BT ID and you’re not sure where to start, follow the link below to BT’s website to get yourself started!</p> \n\n <center><a href=\"https://my.bt.com/s/apps/appsselfserve/index.html#/createbtid\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Create BT ID</a></center>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"BT-TV\">Do you need BT TV to get the BT Sports Monthly pass?</h3> \n\n<p>When it comes to the BT Sports pass, it doesn’t matter if your tv is one from BT, Samsung, Apple, or any other company that makes TVs.</p> \n\n<p>You can’t watch BT Sports in the conventional way through these TVs. You’ll normally have to scroll through your TV guide until you reach the channel numbers for BT Sports. With the BT Sports monthly pass, those channels may still appear, but you won’t be able to watch them as the way you have access to BT Sports is through the BT Sports monthly pass.</p> \n\n<p>Therefore, you can’t watch BT Sports through your TV’s main setup box either, whether that be Sky Q or Virgin Media.</p> \n\n<p>The only way to make the best use of the BT sports pass is through the BT Sports app or through BT’s web player.</p> \n\n \n\n<h2 id=\"Devices\">How can I watch BT Sports on my other devices?</h2> \n\n\n<p>If you have the BT Sports Monthly pass, you’ll be able to watch BT Sports via the BT Sport App or BT’s online web player across your devices.</p> \n\n<p>This includes devices such as an Amazon firestick, on iOS phones and tablets, and on game consoles such as Xbox and Playstation.</p> \n\n<p>But, what if you don’t have the BT Sports pass, and have instead signed up fully for BT Sports with a fixed contract?</p> \n\n<p>Well, you’ve just given yourself some more options for where to watch your sporting content!</p> \n\n<p>Signing up fully for BT Sports means that as long as you have BT broadband, you can watch BT Sports across a range of platforms now, including Sky TV and Virgin Media TV.</p> \n\n<p>Sky have somewhat of a joint venture with BT, where they sell broadband and TV packages that particularly advertise the inclusion of BT Sports as part of the package, or Sky Sports as part of the package when taking up BT broadband.</p> \n\n\n<h3 id=\"BT-Sky\">BT Sports with Sky TV</h3> \n\n<p>One of the biggest ways you can access BT Sports is through Sky TV, and BT advertises deals where you can watch BT Sports if you’re a Sky TV customer.</p> \n\n<p>The Big Sports package mentioned earlier in this piece is one of those deals!!</p> \n\n<p><b>BT SPORT ON SKY - 1 Month Rolling Contract</b> - This TV package includes all of BT Sports channels and the channel BoxNation, with the ability to watch them through your Sky Q or any Sky box in a standard definition screen quality. Depending on speeds and timing, it can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 4 hours for you to have access to BT Sports once this deal’s been purchased, and this is the same with all the advertised packages.</p> \n\n<p>The 1 month rolling contract deal is priced at £29.99 a month, with a £35 upfront cost.  (The upfront cost is more expensive because this is a rolling contract, meaning that it’s not fixed and you have greater flexibility to cancel BT Sports at any time).</p> \n\n<p><b>BT SPORT ON SKY - 12 Month Contract</b></p>- This is almost exactly the same deal and includes exactly the same channels as the 1 month rolling contract package, the only difference being that this is for a fixed term of 12 months which has an effect on the price.<p></p> \n\n<p>This package costs £29.99, exactly the same as the 1 month rolling, but the biggest difference here is the initial upfront cost you’d be paying. It’s only £20!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Cancel\">How do I cancel BT Sport?</h2> \n\n<p>If you’ve decided BT Sports isn’t for you anymore, then you may be thinking about cancelling BT Sports altogether.</p> \n\n<p>Be aware that you’ll have to give BT a minimum notice period of around 30 days, so you won’t be able to ring up and cancel on the day! Once you’ve cancelled, the service will run for the next 30 days and then stop.</p> \n\n<p>It’s possible to do this, and the easiest way to do so would be to contact BT directly over the phone to cancel BT Sports with them. Make sure you have your account number ready for them to speed up the process. Your account number will be located on any billing emails BT have sent you, or on a paper bill sent through the post.</p> \n\n<p>The number to cancel BT Sports is 0800 783 1401.</p> \n\n<p>BT’s customer service is open:</p> \n\n<p>Monday to Fridays: 8am to 9pm</p> \n<p>Saturdays: 8am to 8pm</p> \n<p>Sundays: 9am to 6pm</p> \n\n<p>If you’re a customer of one of BT’s flexible TV packages, and you would like to pause your BT Sport subscription to the monthly pass, this is possible. Pausing it means you can return to BT Sports at a later date.</p> \n\n<p>If you’re unable to contact BT’s customer service, or would prefer to cancel online, then these are the steps to follow:</p> \n\n<p>Log into your ‘My BT’ account</p> \n<p>Find your monthly pass to BT Sports under your subscriptions</p> \n<p>Select the ‘Cancel subscription’ option</p> \n\n<p>From there, you’ll be directed to follow the advice on cancelling the BT Sports pass, and may have to answer some questions as to your reasons for cancelling. Once you’ve gone through the necessary process, your subscription to the BT Sport Monthly Pass should no longer be active.</p>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/app","category":"app"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/cancel","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/halo","category":"halo"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/guide","category":"guide"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/moving-home","category":"moving-home"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/box","category":"box"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/bt-sport","provider":"BT"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
