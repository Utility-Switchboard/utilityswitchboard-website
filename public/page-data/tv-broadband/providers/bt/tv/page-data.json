So, whether you love your box sets, shows, sports, or cinema, there’s something to suit everyone.</p>\n\n<p>BT is very proud of its flexible TV packages, which you can change each month depending on what you want to watch. So, if you only want the sports package to watch a specific sporting event, simply log into your online account and upgrade your package for the month.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a bit of information on each package to help you decide which one is right for you.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Package</th>\n        <th>Price per month</th>\n        <th>Contract length</th>\n        <th>Channels</th>\n        <th>Upfront cost</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Entertainment</td>\n        <td>£12</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n        <td>90+</td>\n        <td>£20</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Sport</td>\n        <td>£15</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n        <td>5</td>\n        <td>£20</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Big Entertainment</td>\n        <td>£22</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n        <td>100+</td>\n        <td>£20</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Big Sport</td>\n        <td>£40</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n        <td>18</td>\n        <td>£20</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>VIP</td>\n        <td>£65</td>\n        <td>24 months</td>\n        <td>120+</td>\n        <td>£20</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><em>*These prices are excluding BT Broadband.</em></p>\n\n<p>Some of these packages include NOW TV subscriptions, however, if your selected package doesn’t, you can always add one in later. You can choose from a range of different subscriptions to allow you to have all your shows in one place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"channels\">BT TV channels to watch out for</h3>\n\n<p>With so many different BT TV channels, you’ll be inundated with choice. So, we’ve sifted through to find some of the best BT TV channels to look out for to find your new favourite shows.</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>AMC</b> – BT TV customers can make the most of the American network, AMC. It’s not available on other subscription TV services such as Sky and lets you watch all your favourite US shows you can’t find anywhere else, including Fear the Walking Dead, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad.</li>\n<li><b>BT Sport</b> – No matter your favourite sport, you can watch them all on the BT Sport channels. Whether you’re into football, rugby, gymnastics, eSports, Poker, or something else, there’s a sports channel for you.</li>\n<li><b>Sky Comedy</b> – If you fancy some laughs, switch to Sky Comedy which you can get with your NOW TV pass. You’ll find old favourites such as Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Sex and the City and make new ones like Moonbase 8.</li>\n<li><b>Food Network</b> – Foodies can improve their cooking skills, get inspired, and simply enjoy the beauty of food with Food Network. If you’re looking for recipes or just love cooking competitions, Food Network is a great place to be.</li>\n<li><b>Sky Cinema Premiere</b> – With your NOW TV Cinema pass, you get to enjoy films on TV before anyone else. You’ll be treated to a new premiere every day so you won’t miss out on any of the biggest hits.</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"broadband\">BT TV and broadband deals</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re looking to upgrade to BT TV, you’ll also have to switch to BT Broadband but that’s definitely not a bad thing! With maximum fibre speeds of 900Mbps, it’s definitely a great provider to consider.</p>\n\n<p>You can get BT Fibre 2 broadband and the BT Entertainment package for just £44.99 per month which includes average speeds of over 70Mbps, 90 TV channels, a membership to NOW TV Entertainment pass, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Or opt for the BT Sports package with Fibre 2 broadband for just £3 extra and receive all the Freeview channels, AMC, and all 4 BT Sport channels and BoxNation.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../broadband/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Find out more about BT's broadband packages</a></center>\n\n<p>However, if you’re in one of the few areas where fibre isn’t available yet, you might have to compromise. While you won’t be able to opt for one of the traditional BT TV packages, there are still packages available in which you can access Freeview channels and AMC on your TV and the rest of the channels in your package through the BT TV app.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"add-ons\">Add-ons</h2>\n\n<p>When choosing your BT TV packages, there are a number of add-ons to choose from to personalise your subscription and have everything you need in one place. You can add extra channels, upgrade to watch in HD, or even in a different room.</p>\n\n<p>With BT’s flexible TV packages, you can create the best package for you from month to month.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Add-on</th>\n        <th>Price per month</th>\n        <th>Contract length</th>\n        <th>Includes...</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>NOW Sky Sports</td>\n        <td>£33.99</td>\n        <td>1 month</td>\n        <td>11 Sky Sports channels</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>NOW Sky Cinema</td>\n        <td>£11.99</td>\n        <td>1 month</td>\n        <td>Sky Cinema channels and films on-demand</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>BT Kids</td>\n        <td>£5</td>\n        <td>1 month</td>\n        <td>7 premium kid’s channels live and on-demand</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>HD</td>\n        <td>£5</td>\n        <td>1 month</td>\n        <td>TV packages in HD, Ultra HD and 4K</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Extra box</td>\n        <td>£5</td>\n        <td>1 month</td>\n        <td>An extra TV box to watch in a second room (you’ll need a separate aerial connection)</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h3 id=\"app-extra\">BT TV App Extra</h3>\n\n<p>With the BT TV app, customers can watch all their favourite shows and films on their computer, phone, or tablet. This is great for watching on the go, when you can’t use the TV, or if you want to watch in your own time.</p>\n\n<p>However, for £5 per month, you can upgrade to BT TV App Extra, giving you so many more options. When you upgrade, you’ll get all the benefits of the free app, as well as being able to watch and download Catch-Up, On-Demand, rental and Buy-to-Own shows and films.</p>\n\n<p>This upgrade also allows you to register the app on four devices rather than two and even watch on your smart TV, including Amazon Fire, Apple, and Samsung TVs.</p>\n\n<p>You can upgrade to BT TV App Extra through your online account, using the live chat service, or by calling 0800 800 150.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.bt.com/tv/appextra/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out more about BT TV App Extra</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"store\">BT TV Film Store and TV Store</h3>\n\n<p>BT TV customers can take advantage of their subscription by using the Film Store and TV Store to watch to their heart’s content on their BT TV Box or app.</p>\n\n<p>If you missed out on shows and films while they were available on Catch-Up or just want to watch them on repeat, you can use the stores to buy or rent whatever you like.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the Film Store and TV Store are only for BT TV customers, however, you can find most of the content elsewhere and they’re most likely available on NOW TV or other subscription services.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.player.bt.com/#/filmstore\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit the film store</a></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://www.player.bt.com/#/tvstore\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit the TV store</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"tv-box\">Types of BT TV box</h2>\n\n<p>With BT, there are three different TV boxes to choose from: two recordable and one normal.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the non-recordable TV Box Z4, you can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Pause and rewind live TV for up to 30 minutes</li>\n<li>Watch all channels in your subscription in HD</li>\n<li>Access on-demand players from BBC, All4, BT Player, and more</li>\n<li>Catch up on TV from the last 7 days</li>\n<li>Search for your favourite shows</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you have the Recordable Box G4, you can do all of the things the Z4 can do, as well as:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Pause, record and rewind live TV for up to 2 hours</li>\n<li>Record up to 300 hours of TV</li>\n<li>Record remotely using the BT TV app</li></ul>\n\n<p>The Recordable Box G5 does exactly the same as the G4, however, it lets you watch all of your shows and films in Ultra HD if your TV allows it.</p>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/box","category":"box"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/bt-sport","category":"bt-sport"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/app","category":"app"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/cancel","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/halo","category":"halo"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/guide","category":"guide"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/moving-home","category":"moving-home"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv","provider":"BT"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
