BT Cloud enables you to back up all your photos, videos, music, contacts, and other documents all in one place in case you ever lose them.</li> \n<li><b>BT Sports App</b> - If you’re a subscriber to BT Sports, then this app enables you to watch all of the content BT Sports provides across its channels on the go, all in high definition.</li> \n<li><b>BT MeetMe with Dolby</b> - This app enables you to join and host audio meetings from your smartphone and/or other devices. The Dolby aspects of this app is an attempt to aid in the video and sound quality of this online meeting service.</li> \n<li><b>BT Voice Cloud Communications</b> - This is a telephone communication system that aids BT Business in establishing sound connections between a business’ broadband, mobile, telephone, systems, domains, and email.</li> \n<li><b>BT Business</b> - With the BT Business app, you can view all your company’s bills, make payments when necessary, check your company accounts, track orders and faults with your systems, plus much more!</li> \n<li><b>BT TV</b> - BT customers who download this app can use the BT TV app to watch all their favourite channels and shows on demand with their BT TV subscription.</li></ul> \n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Download\">How can I download My BT app?</h2> \n\n<p>With this app, you can control your BT account whenever, and wherever, you like.</p> \n\n<p>You can download it from either the Apple App store for iPhones and Apple devices, or via the Google Play store for Android devices.</p> \n\n\n<div class=\"app-store-double\">\n    <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/my-bt/id979618672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/6tIOkBxFcLxfaYYwZG3ZRB/e1fc27b6d3e34a179640a88548bd5d2e/download-app-store.png\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bt.btserviceapp&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/7hmRcicCQzLoZWs5oJZ7Mx/d1ec589bffb6a56079ac155a701b0cc7/download-google-play.png\"></a>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The app is compatible with versions of Android from 6 upwards and version 10 of iOS and later models.</p>\n\n \n<h2 id=\"BTApp\">What can I do with My BT App?</h2> \n\n\n<p>Having the My BT app means that you can do things such as changing your payment or direct debit details, updating your address if you’ve moved home, or creating a new password if you’re looking to make your BT account more secure.</p> \n\n\n<p>This means you can check on the data, texts, and calls you’re using for all the mobile phones registered to your account.</p> \n\n<p>You can also check how often you’re using your landline and broadband. This is actually a really useful tool because you could potentially look to save yourself some money and downgrade your broadband package.</p> \n\n<p>You can check services in your area, this is useful if you have a neighbour, who also has BT, who’s had recent difficulties with their internet and broadband connections.</p> \n\n<p>The app will enable you to see if you’re encountering any of the same problems and what you can do to solve them. If you’ve recently purchased something from BT, such as a new router or a tv box, then you can track your order and see how far away it is from your front door.</p> \n\n<p>It's popular amongst BT customers, having gained a ranking of 4 stars out of 5 based on nearly 72,000 reviews, according to the Apple App store and 3 out of 5 on Google Play based on nearly 13,000 reviews.</p>  \n\n<p>You can also set parental controls and time limits if you’re a BT customer with a young family. So, you can control what your children have access to online, and what time the broadband switches off at night.</p> \n\n<p>Unless your kids have My BT installed on their devices, they won’t be able to turn it back on.</p> \n\n<p>Almost literally, the power of your internet is in your hands!</p> \n \n\n<h2 id=\"Cant-access\">Can’t access the My BT app?</h2>  \n\n<p>If you can’t access the My BT app, it’s probably for a number of reasons.</p> \n\n<p>The first thing to check is that you have at least an active landline established with BT. If this isn’t the case, then chances are you won’t be able to access the app at all.</p> \n\n<p>However, wondering how to use the My BT app suggests you are an active BT customer. Just make sure that no wires have become disconnected from your landline, as that could be a reason as to why you can’t gain access to the app. It’s because your landline connection to BT has been cut off!</p> \n\n<p>If, however, it’s a case of trying to access the My BT app for the first time, here are a few things to remember:</p> \n\n<ul><li>If you’re trying to log in for the first time, remember that you’ll need to have a BT ID in place. This usually consists of a username and password.</li> \n<li>Once that’s been set up, BT will prompt you to create a 4-digit-PIN. This will make it easier to log in the next time you want to use the app.</li> \n<li>With the 4-digit PIN in place, you’ll also be able to log in via fingerprint touch on both iPhone and Android devices.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Not-working\">Other reasons the My BT app isn’t working</h3> \n\n<ul><li>No BT ID in place - first things first, you’ll need a BT ID if you want to log into the My BT app. You can create one online. What you’ll need is your BT billing account number (usually located in the top right corner of your bill) and it should be made up of around 2 letters and 8 numbers, though this could differ.</li> \n<li>Forgetting your BT ID - Your BT username is usually an email address. Don’t worry if you can’t remember it, it’s really easy to get a reminder online at BT. You’ll just need either your landline number or email address, and the answer to the security question you chose when first setting up your BT account.</li></ul> \n\n<p>Here’s a button with a link to BT’s reminder page below if you’ve forgotten your ID.</p> \n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.bt.com/s/apps/appsselfserve/index.html#/forgotlogindetails?srfd=y\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">BT Forgot ID Button </a></center> \n\n\n<ul><li>Forgot your password - When you first set up your BT ID, you will have created a password. The show password option is good because you can actually see what your password is and check it’s correct, all whilst remaining case sensitive. However, if you can’t remember your password and want it changing, then you can reset it online.</li></ul> \n  \n        <center><a href=\"https://my.bt.com/s/apps/appsselfserve/index.html#/forgotlogindetails?srfd=y\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Forgot BT password button</a></center>\n\n\n<ul><li>No account added - If there’s no account added to your online BT ID, then this is a really easy quick fix. You’ll need your account number, and once you have that, you’ll be able to add your BT account online so you’ll have access to the My BT app.</li></ul> \n\n <center><a href=\"https://home.bt.com/login/loginform\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Add BT Account</a></center>\n\n<ul><li>Still not working with the correct ID - If the My BT app still isn’t working, even when you have the correct ID, password etc. then it’s probably a fault on BT’s side and not yours, so try opening your BT account via a search engine on a web browser like Google Chrome and see if it works.</li></ul> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"BT-Sports-App\">Does BT Sports have an app?</h2> \n\n<p>Yes, BT Sports has an app, and it’s probably one of the most, if not the most, popular apps that BT has to offer.</p> \n\n<p>From the BT Sports app, you can gain access to all the BT Sports channels, and be able to watch all the action on your portable devices or computer if the tv is taken.</p> \n\n<p>This includes being able to watch the Premier League, football from around the European leagues, including the Champions League, Australia’s Big Bash League, NBA, UFC, and much more!</p> \n\n<p>The app itself doesn’t cost anything, but you’ll need to have a BT account and BT broadband in place in order to access it, and because the cost of their broadband packages differ, then the cost of gaining access to the app differs. Really, it’s all down to your broadband package.</p> \n\n<p>The BT Sports app is available to download either on the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, depending on what devices you have.</p> \n\n<p>If you want to download the BT Sports app and gain access to all the sporting action BT has to offer, click on one of the two buttons below, depending on whether your devices are Android or Apple.</p> \n \n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"smarthub\">How to set up your smart hub using the BT broadband app</h2> \n\n<p>You’ll be able to set up your BT Smart Hub and the broadband discs with the My BT app.</p> \n\n<p>The process you have to follow is to go to the Home Screen and select More. Once you’ve done this, your Wifi network should appear with the option to set up a new broadband disc and establish a new broadband connection.</p> \n\n<p>A handy thing that happens from here is that once your disc has been set up, it’ll suggest a recommended spot through your app as to where the disc should be placed in your house in order to have the fastest broadband connection available.</p>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/broadband","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/router","category":"router"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/box","category":"box"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/moving-home","category":"moving-home"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/bt-sport","category":"bt-sport"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/cancel","category":"broadband"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/halo","category":"halo"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/tv/guide","category":"guide"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/bt/app","provider":"BT"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
