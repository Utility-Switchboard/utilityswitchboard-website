Because of this, switching to Virgin Media may require some digging to be done by engineers outside your property to get you connected. This is one of the reasons why it’s not available to everyone.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gigabit\">Gigabit Broadband</h3>\n\n<p>For just £52 per month, you could receive a massive 1130Mbps download speed with Virgin Media’s Gig1 Fibre Broadband. This is enough to have everyone online streaming in Ultra HD, gaming, and video calling at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Gig1 Fibre Broadband is available in even fewer locations than Virgin Media’s other fibre packages, however, Virgin is working on making this available to a huge number of cities by the end of 2021 and more going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Gig1 Fibre is currently available at selected locations in:</p>\n<ol class=\"jumbo-ol\"><li>Belfast</li>\n<li>Birmingham</li>\n<li>Cardiff</li>\n<li>Coventry</li>\n<li>Edinburgh</li>\n<li>Glasgow</li>\n<li>Leeds</li>\n<li>Liverpool</li>\n<li>London</li>\n<li>Manchester</li>\n<li>Reading</li>\n<li>Southampton</li></ol>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in Gigabit Broadband but it’s not available in your area yet, you can register your interest here <a href=\"https://www.virginmedia.com/offers/gig1-register-my-interest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to be the first to know when you can upgrade.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/broadband/gig1-gigabit-broadband\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Can you get Gig1 Fibre broadband?</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"add-ons\">Add-ons</h2>\n\n<p>Once you’ve decided to switch to Virgin Media broadband, there is a range of different things you can add to save money and make the most of your package.</p> \n\n<h3 id=\"bundles\">Bundles</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re with Virgin Media, you can create your own package including broadband, TV, phone and/or mobile. Starting with the Big Bundle of Mixit TV, M50 Fibre, and Talk Weekend landline services, you can add, remove, and customise as many services as you like in your bundle. </p>\n\n<p>Add channel packs to your TV for £7 each per month, speed up your broadband, and receive more inclusive calls depending on when you make the most calls. Or remove whichever you don’t need.</p>\n\n<p>The only limitation is that you’ll have to have broadband in your bundle if you want Virgin Media TV.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/bundles\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Create your perfect bundle</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"intelligent-wifi\">Virgin Intelligent WiFi Plus</h3>\n\n<p>If you have a Hub 3 or Hub 4, your router will come with Virgin Intelligent WiFi.
