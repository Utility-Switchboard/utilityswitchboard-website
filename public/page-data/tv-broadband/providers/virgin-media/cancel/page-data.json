However, you’ll have to cancel Virgin Media yourself if you want to leave them. While this can be difficult, we’ve put together a guide to help the switching process run smoothly.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dfference\">Why is cancelling Virgin Media different to other providers?</h2>\n\n<p>Most providers use the same network of cables to connect your home to the internet. Whether you’re using the copper or fibre cables, they’re all part of the same network owned by Openreach. This makes it easy to switch providers as they can all use the same lines to get you connected.</p>\n\n<p>However, Virgin Media has its own network of cables that bypass the broadband cabinet you see on the streets to bring fibre straight to your home. This is called ‘<b><a href=\"/tv-broadband/guides/netowrk/fibre/fttp/\">Fibre to the Premises</a></b>’ and can offer immense speeds of up to 1Gbps.</p>\n\n<p>Because it owns its own cables detached from the Openreach network, they will need to be installed in your home separately if you want to switch to Virgin Media. This also means that it will need to be disconnected separately in order to switch back to the Openreach network.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-cancel\">How to cancel Virgin Media</h2>\n\n<p>There are two ways you can cancel your broadband package: by phone, or in writing.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to cancel Virgin Media is over the phone. You can call 150 from your Virgin Media phone or mobile or 0345 454 1111 from any other phone. Bear in mind that you might have to pay for this call - the best time to ring is 8am Monday-Friday or 9am on Saturday to cut down your time on hold.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can write to:<br>\nVirgin Media Sales Operation Support<br>\nDiamond Plaza<br>\nDaleside Road<br>\nNottingham<br>\nNG2 3GG</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to include your account number, address, full name, and phone number in your letter so that you can be contacted about your cancellation. This, however, will result in a slower cancellation time, so it’s recommended to call.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"notice-period\">What is Virgin Media broadband’s notification period?</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to leave Virgin Media, whether you’re in our outside of your minimum term, you’ll need to give at least 30 days notice but you can give it up to 60 days.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to cancel by post, you’ll need to make sure that your letter arrives at Virgin Media 30-60 days before you want to cancel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"router\">What to do with your WiFi router when you cancel</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll have to either return or recycle your old equipment.</p>\n\n<p>You should return:</p>\n<ul><li>Virgin TV V6 box</li>\n<li>Virgin Hub 3</li>\n<li>Virgin Hub 4</li>\n<li>WiFi boosters and pods</li>\n<li>Super Hub 2AC</li></ul>\n\n<p>These can be reused by Virgin Media and given to other customers. </p>\n\n<p>If you don’t return your equipment, you could have to pay an added fee. This equipment also won’t work with other providers so they’re not worth keeping anyway!</p>\n\n<center><a href='https://www.virginmedia.com/help/virgin-media-return-or-recycle-equipment/returns' target=\"_blank\" class='curve-btn-main btn-white' rel=\"noopener\">Return your equipment</a></center>\n\n<p>If you have an older or another kit not mentioned here, you should recycle them instead.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this at your local waste management facility or recycling centre. If you don’t know where this is, you can use the link below to find the closest one to you.</p>\n\n<center><a href='https://www.virginmedia.com/help/virgin-media-return-or-recycle-equipment/recycle' target=\"_blank\" class='curve-btn-main btn-white' rel=\"noopener\">Recycle your equipment</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancellation-charge\">Do you have to pay to leave Virgin Media?</h2>\n\n<p>In some cases, you might have to pay to cancel your Virgin Media package.</p>\n\n<p>The most common reason people are charged to cancel is that they are leaving within the minimum term of their contract. Virgin Media’s minimum terms are usually 9, 12, 18, or 24 months, depending on your package. You can find out how long your contract is through the ‘My Bills’ section of your online account.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also have to pay if you’re moving house. Even if you can’t get Virgin Media in your new home, if you’re mid-contract, you’ll still have to pay an early disconnection fee.</p> \n\n<h3>Virgin Media cancellation fee</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re leaving Virgin Media mid-contract, you may have to pay an early termination fee. How much you pay depends on which package you’re on and how long is left on your contract. This doesn’t include your notice period.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re on a broadband-only package, you can use the table below to work out how much you’ll have to pay.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Package</th>\n        <th>Price per month left on your contract</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>M50</td>\n        <td>£30.54</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>M100</td> \n        <td>£35.52</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>M200 </td>\n        <td>£40.50</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>M350</td>\n        <td>£45.48 pm</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>M500</td>\n        <td>£50.46</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Gig1</td>\n        <td>£49.98</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>If you have another package, you can find your Virgin Media cancellation fee using the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href='https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/the-legal-stuff/terms-and-conditions-for-fibre-optic-services/early-disconnection-fees' target=\"_blank\" class='curve-btn-main btn-white' rel=\"noopener\">View your Virgin Media cancellation fee</a></center>\n \n\n<h2 id=\"cancel-free\">How to cancel Virgin Media for free</h2>\n\n<p>There are a few circumstances where you might be able to cancel Virgin Media for free, including:</p>\n<ul><li>During the first 14 days of your contract (called your 'cooling off period'</li>\n<li>If you’re outside of your minimum term</li>\n<li>If you’re not getting the minimum speed promised and it can’t be fixed</li>\n<li>If your service is faulty and can’t be fixed</li>\n<li>If Virgin Media put their prices up mid-contract</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"moving-house\">How to cancel Virgin Media when you’re moving house</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re moving house, you’ll have to contact Virgin Media, whether you’re planning on cancelling or not. You can do this by calling 150 from a Virgin Media phone or mobile or 0345 454 1111 from any other phone.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if Virgin Media broadband isn’t available in your new home, you’ll still have to pay early termination fees if you’re in the middle of your contract. While this may seem unfair, it has been looked into and allowed by Ofcom, the communications regulator.</p>\n\n<p>If Virgin Media is available in your new home and you want to bring your package with you, you’ll have to pay a £20 movers fee to get set up in your new home.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refund\">What happens if you’re owed a refund</h2>\n\n<p>Because you pay for your services in advance, you might be due a refund for services you don’t use. This refund will be sent as a cheque 35 days after your Virgin Media account has been cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re owed a refund but don’t receive the cheque within 50 days, you should contact Virgin Media on 0345 454 1111. Alternatively, you can use the live chat service on Virgin Media’s website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"stay-with-virgin\">Should I stay with Virgin Media?</h2>\n\n<p>While you might be set on cancelling, Virgin Media cancellation fees may be making you reconsider if you’re not far into your contract.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the advantages of Virgin Media include:</p>\n<ul><li>Extremely high speeds</li>\n<li>Wide variety of services</li>\n<li>Free servicing and repairs</li>\n<li>Data-free messaging (Virgin Mobile customers)</li>\n<li>WiFi on the London Underground</li>\n<li>Internet security included</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you’re still thinking of switching or cancelling, be ready to stand your ground against the customer service agents trying to make you stay.</p>\n\n<p>To make sure you’re on the best broadband deal for you, give Utility Switchboard a call on...</p>\n\n<center><a href='tel:+442030484598' class='btn-phone btn-pink'>020 3048 4598</a></center>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/broadband","category":"broadband"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/cancel","provider":"Virgin Media"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
