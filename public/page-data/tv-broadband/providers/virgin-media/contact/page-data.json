We’ve got the answers to some of your questions and the different ways to contact Virgin Media depending on your query.</b></p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about my bill(s)</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to paying your bills, Virgin Media have made it really easy for you. The easiest and most common way to pay is by direct debit, however, you can also pay:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through your <a href=\"https://my.virginmedia.com/my-bills/index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My Virgin Media account</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://payments.virginmedia.com/epayments/notloggedinaccountdetails_ecare.jsf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Online without a My Virgin Media account</a></li>\n<li>Through the app</li>\n<li>By calling 0800 064 3777</li>\n<li>At a PayPoint or Post Office</li>\n<li>Through your bank (sort code: <b>20-13-42</b> account number: <b>23494314</b> using your 14-digit payment reference number as the reference)</li>\n<li>By cheque (with your name, account number, and postcode on the back) to:<br>\nVirgin Media Payments Ltd<br>\nPO Box 4014<br>\nWorthing<br>\nSussex<br>\nBN13 1WE</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you need help or have any other questions about your bills, you can call Virgin Media on 0345 454 1111 or use the live chat feature on their website.</p>\n\n<h3>If you’re having trouble paying…</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re struggling to pay your bills, the first thing you should do is contact Virgin Media and let them know. They can work with you to come up with a solution to suit both of you. This could be setting up a payment plan, giving you extra time to pay your bill, or reducing your services for a short while.</p>\n\n<p>If you miss payments, you might be charged a late payment fee of £7.50. Your broadband speed might also be slowed or you might be restricted to fewer channels on your TV subscription until you pay the full amount. Virgin Media will contact you before your services are restricted and again afterwards to let you know what you need to pay to restore your account.</p>\n\n<p>For help paying your bills, you can contact Virgin Media on 0800 052 0360.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"speed\">Check your broadband speed</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re concerned about your broadband speeds, you can use the Virgin Media speed test to find out how fast you’re actually running. The test will give you your average upload and download speeds, which you can compare against your tariff to check you’re receiving the speeds you were promised.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/broadband/speed-test\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Do a speed test</a></center>\n\n<p>If you have a Hub 3 or Hub 4, any problems you have with your WiFi (including speed issues) should be fixed automatically. These routers use Intelligent WiFi to detect and fix issues automatically to help you make the most of your broadband. If it can’t fix itself and a repair is needed, an engineer will come out and sort the problem with no added costs.</p>\n\n<h3>Report speed issues</h3>\n\n<p>If the speeds you’re seeing are lower than those promised, you can report this to Virgin Media by calling 0345 454 1111.</p>\n\n<p>Virgin Media guarantees broadband speeds of at least 50% of the advertised speed. If you don’t receive these speeds for three consecutive days and/or the problem is unable to be fixed within 30 days, you can cancel your contract without having to pay any exit fees.</p>\n\n<h3>Get a WiFi booster</h3>\n\n<p>If your WiFi doesn’t reach certain spots in your house, you can benefit from WiFi extenders to make sure every room in the house has a reliable internet connection.</p>\n\n<p>Simply use the Virgin Media Connect app to scan the room for blackspots. If there are any, you can order a WiFi booster to combat the problem. You can order them through the app once the blackspots have been identified – the app will take you to the right page.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind, you might have to pay up to £5 per month for your WiFi boosters unless you’re on the Ultimate Oomph or Gig1 package which come with Intelligent WiFi Pods.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"connection-issues\">Connection issues</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re experiencing connection issues on multiple devices, the first thing you should check is whether there are any known faults in the area. You can do this by signing into your My Virgin Media account where you can also run tests and book an engineer.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.virginmedia.com/faults/service-status\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Check for faults</a></center>\n\n<p>The next thing to try is restarting your router. You can do this either at the wall or using the power button. Alternatively, you can reset your router using the button on the back (you’ll need a pen or pin to reach it). Hold the button down for 10 seconds and give your router 5-10 minutes to fully reset. Bear in mind that this will reset the hub to its factory settings, including changing the name and password.</p>\n\n<p>If it’s just one device struggling to connect, it’s likely a problem with the device rather than the router. Make sure the WiFi is turned on and flight mode is off. If your WiFi is on, try turning it off and on again or disconnecting and reconnecting.</p>\n\n[tv_broadband_slow_speeds_cta]\n\n<p>If you’re still having trouble, you can contact Virgin Media on 0345 454 1111 or book an engineer through your My Virgin Media account.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving house</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re moving house, you’ll have to cancel Virgin Media subscriptions before you go. To do this, you should contact Virgin Media to give them notice that you’re moving so they can help disconnect your services and get you set up in your new home. Bear in mind that there is a £20 movers fee.</p>\n\n[tv_broadband_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>When you move, you can stay on the same package, however, you might need an engineer to come and install the cables again. If someone has had Virgin Media broadband at the property in the past, you should be able to complete the set-up yourself as the home should already be connected.</p>\n\n<p>Because not all homes are eligible for Virgin Media broadband, you might not be able to bring your provider with you to your new home. If this is the case, you’ll have to cancel your broadband package and may still be subject to early cancellation fees.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Complain about Virgin Media</h2>\n\n<p>If something’s gone wrong with your Virgin Media TV or broadband package and you’d like to make a complaint, there are a few ways you can do so:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Call 0345 454 1111</li>\n<li>Using the live chat service</li>\n<li>Online</li>\n<li>By post to:<br>\nVirgin Media<br>\nSunderland<br>\nSR43 4AA</li></ul>\n\n<p>When you complain to Virgin, make sure to include your account number, address, email, and/or phone number so they can respond and resolve your complaint.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/contactus/make-a-complaint\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a complaint</a></center>\n\n<p>Once your complaint has been made, you can track its progress and receive updates through your online account. Virgin will try to respond to and resolve your issue as best they can, but if you’re still not happy, you can ask for it to be escalated to a manager.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could email the Head of Complaints, Daniel Potts, directly at daniel.potts@virginmedia.co.uk. This should allow you to get your complaint resolved faster and more effectively.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancel\">How to cancel Virgin Media packages</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re a Virgin Media broadband customer and want to cancel your TV or other services, you can do so through your My Virgin Media account. Simply click the link below and you can upgrade, downgrade, or change your package with exclusive deals for existing customers.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://store.virginmedia.com/existing-customer/my-offers/offers\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Update your package</a></center>\n\n<p>If you want to switch to another provider, you’ll have to contact Virgin Media to cancel your package first, giving 30 days’ notice. The best way to do this is by calling 0345 454 1111 to talk to the customer service team.</p>\n\n<p>If you do decide to switch, you may have to pay early cancellation fees, which you can find out more about below. You’ll also have to return any equipment you’re given, such as your hub and TV box or you could face an extra fee for those too.</p>\n\n<p>However, as you pay for your services in advance, you might be due a refund for services you don’t use that month. This will be sent as a cheque within 35 days of you cancelling your package.</p>\n\n<h3>Virgin Media cancellation fees</h3>\n\n<p>If you cancel your Virgin Media services before the end of your contract, you’ll have to pay an extra fee. How much you pay will depend on a number of factors: How much you pay per month How long is left on your contract How much Virgin Media will save by you leaving early.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you pay £30 per month, have 5 months left on your contract, and Virgin Media are saving £5 per month from you leaving, this will be calculated as (£30-£5) x 4 months (because your notice period isn’t included in your exit fees), bringing your early disconnection fees to £100.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out how much you can expect to pay using the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/the-legal-stuff/terms-and-conditions-for-fibre-optic-services/early-disconnection-fees\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Early cancellation fees</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Contact Virgin Media about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you need to talk about, you can use the Virgin Media contact details below to get your questions answered and problems solved.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone</td>\n        <td>0345 454 1111</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Text</td>\n        <td>07533051809</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/virginmedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/virginmedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@VirginMedia</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Community forum</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://community.virginmedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/cancel","category":"cancel"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/tv","category":"tv"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/broadband","category":"broadband"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/contact","provider":"Virgin Media"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
