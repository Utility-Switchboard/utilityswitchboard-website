While setting up your broadband package may not be top of the list, it’s important to get it sorted sooner rather than later.</b></p>\n\n<p>This page is here to help get your broadband set up in your new home as easily as possible. As always, we’ve got you covered!</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-move\">How to move broadband to a new house</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to broadband, moving house is much easier than many people think. In most cases, there’s no need for an engineer when it comes to installation.</p>\n\n<p>Because most providers use the same network of wires and cables to connect houses to the internet, the setup is quick and easy. Your provider will take over the entire process - all you have to do is plug in your router on or near your activation date and you’re ready to go!</p>\n\n<p>Most providers will ask for 30 days’ notice before you move house so that they can start the switching process and moving your broadband package to your new home. If you give enough notice, your broadband might even be up and running as soon as you move in!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"same-provider\">Can I stay with the same provider when I move house?</h2>\n\n<p>Most of the time, you can stay with the same provider when you move. However, you don’t have to.</p>\n\n<p>When deciding whether or not to stay with the same provider, there are a few things you should consider:</p>\n<ul><li><b>Will you have to pay any extra fees?</b> Sometimes, providers will charge a fee to move your broadband package to your new house. Some providers will even make you cancel your package and sign up for a new one, meaning you’ll be paying early termination charges too.</li>\n<li><b>Will you get the same speeds at your new house?</b> You won’t necessarily get the same speeds at your new house as your old house. The speeds you can get depend on a number of factors, including how far you are away from the cabinet. Hopefully, you’ll be closer and can experience faster broadband after moving house.</li>\n<li><b>Does your provider cover your area/home?</b> If your provider doesn’t have coverage at your new home, you might be able to leave mid-contract without paying any extra fees. Even if they do have coverage in your area, they might not be able to service your house.</li>\n<li><b>Are you happy with your provider?</b> If you’re not happy with your provider and want to switch your broadband, moving home is the perfect time to do it! This is because you might be able to leave your contract without paying exit fees. You should check this in your contract first.</li>\n<li><b>How much notice do you need to give?</b> Most providers ask for 15-30 days notice to make sure that the switching process is completed when you move. Whether you’re staying with your provider or switching, make sure you tell your provider in time so you’re not paying two bills.</li></ul>\n\n<h3>What do if your provider doesn’t have coverage at your new house</h3>\n\n<p>If your current provider doesn’t cover the area you’re moving to, you don’t have much choice but to switch providers in your new home if you want a reliable broadband connection. While you can opt for other options such as 4G and 5G or satellite connections, the easiest thing to do is switch to a new provider.</p>\n\n<p>Some providers won’t charge you early termination fees if you’re moving somewhere they can’t provide your broadband and need to cancel your package. However, some still will. It’s important to check your contract to see if you’re going to have to pay extra when you leave.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t let your broadband provider sway where you move to - they likely won’t be the only provider you have for the rest of your life!</p>\n\n<h2>Can I stay on the same package when I move?</h2>\n\n<p>As long as your provider still operates where you live, you can normally stay on the same package if you’d like to.</p>\n\n<p>However, you might want to upgrade or downgrade, depending on what speeds are on offer in your new home. For example, if you can’t get the same speeds as you would at your current home, you might want to downgrade to save money or if you’re reaching the maximum speed for your package, you might want to upgrade to reach even higher speeds.</p>\n\n<p>Most providers will let you upgrade for free, even mid-contract. If your package doesn’t reach the same speeds as in your old house, you can often downgrade for free too, and some providers even offer compensation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact\">How do I contact my broadband provider about moving?</h2>\n\n<p>To make sure you have broadband in your new home, you’ll have to contact your provider to move or cancel your package, especially if you’re mid-contract.</p>\n\n<p>Below are all the details you’ll need to move your broadband to your new house with some of the most popular providers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bt\">Moving house with BT</h3>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Notice period</td>\n        <td>2 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Average switch time</td>\n        <td>2 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone number</td>\n        <td>0800 783 0235</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://home.bt.com/login/loginform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table> \n\n<center><a href='/tv-broadband/providers/bt/moving-home/' class='curve-btn-main btn-white'>Find out more about moving with BT</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"sky\">Moving house with Sky</h3>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Notice period</td> \n        <td>2 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Average switch time</td> \n        <td>2 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone number</td> \n        <td>0333 759 2113</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/moving-home-with-sky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<center><a href='/tv-broadband/providers/sky/moving-home/' class='curve-btn-main btn-white'>Find out more about moving with Sky</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"virgin\">Moving house with Virgin Media</h3>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Notice period</td> \n        <td>30 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Average switch time</td>\n        <td>2 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone number</td>\n        <td>0345 454 1111</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.virginmedia.com/help/moving-home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<center><a href='/tv-broadband/providers/virgin-media/moving-home/' class='curve-btn-main btn-white'>Find out more about moving with Virgin Media</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"talktalk\">Moving house with TalkTalk</h3>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Notice period</td> \n        <td>14 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Average switch time</td>\n        <td>2 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone number</td>\n        <td>0345 172 0088</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://myaccount.talktalk.co.uk/homemover/brochure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table> \n\n<center><a href='/tv-broadband/providers/talktalk/moving-home/' class='curve-btn-main btn-white'>Find out more about moving with TalkTalk</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"plusnet\">Moving house with Plusnet</h3>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Notice period</td> \n        <td>4 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Average switch time</td> \n        <td>2 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone number</td>\n        <td>0800 587 1952</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.plus.net/broadband/moving-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<center><a href='/tv-broadband/providers/plusnet/moving-home/' class='curve-btn-main btn-white'>Find out more about moving with Plusnet</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"vodafone\">Moving house with Vodafone</h3>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Notice period</td>\n        <td>30 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Average switch time</td>\n        <td>2 weeks</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone number</td> \n        <td>0333 304 0191</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.vodafone.co.uk/my-vodafone-account/home-moves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<center><a href='/tv-broadband/providers/vodafone/moving-home/' class='curve-btn-main btn-white'>Find out more about moving with Vodafone</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"switching\">Moving house and changing broadband provider</h2>\n\n<p>The perfect time to compare broadband quotes is when you’re moving home. You’re working on moving your broadband to your new home already, and there’s no harm in spending a little more time looking into other broadband providers and packages.</p>\n\n[tv_broadband_moving_house_cta] \n\n<p>If you’re planning on switching broadband when moving house, you’ll have to contact both your new and existing broadband provider. Because you’re changing your address, you’ll have to cancel your broadband package in your old home rather than moving it across.</p>\n\n<p>When looking into new providers, you should consider:</p>\n<ul><li>What speeds you need</li>\n<li>How much you want to pay</li>\n<li>If there are extra fees</li>\n<li>If you want to upgrade your current package or switch provider</li>\n<li>How long is left on your contract</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"fees\">Do you have to pay extra if you move mid-contract?</h2>\n\n<p>Even if you’re moving house mid-contract, you might have to pay early termination fees. Some providers also charge moving fees if you want to bring your provider and package with you.</p>\n\n<p>How much you pay depends on a number of different things:</p>\n<ul><li>The terms of your contract</li>\n<li>How long is left on your contract</li>\n<li>If you have to set up a new contract</li>\n<li>How much you pay per month</li>\n<li>If you’re switching providers or bringing them with you</li>\n<li>If you need an engineer to set it up</li>\n<li>Which provider you’re with</li>\n<li>What type of broadband you have</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"connect\">How long does it take to set up internet in a new house?</h2>\n\n<p>It normally takes around 2 weeks to set up internet in your new house.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve given your provider enough notice, your broadband might be set up already on your move-in date. However, most of the time you’ll be left with no broadband connection for a few days.</p>\n\n<p>According to a Uswitch survey, this is how long households are left without an internet connection in their new homes with different providers:</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Provider</th>\n        <th>Days without broadband</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>BT</td>\n        <td>8 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Sky</td>\n        <td>7 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Plusnet</td>\n        <td>9 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>TalkTalk</td>\n        <td>9 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>EE</td>\n        <td>8 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Vodafone</td>\n        <td>7 days</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Virgin Media</td>\n        <td>6 days</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>If you can’t be without broadband for that long, some providers will give you a mobile broadband router in the meantime to make sure you don’t lose connection. These work similarly to how your phone connects to the internet, using a mobile sim to connect to the 4G or 5G network. If your provider doesn’t offer this, you can buy them from most electronics stores.<p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can use your smartphone as a hotspot. If you’re doing this, you should keep in mind that this will use up the data on your mobile contract, which you won’t be able to use again. According to a survey, one in three movers has run out of mobile data while waiting for their broadband to connect in their new home.</p>"}},"navigation":{"internal":{"content":"{\"How to move your broadband\":\"#how-to-move\",\"Can I transfer my existing contract\":\"#same-provider\",\"How to contact your provider about moving\":\"#contact\",\"Switching when you move house\":\"#switching\",\"Fees associated with moving\":\"#fees\",\"How long to set up in new house\":\"#connect\"}"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandGuideStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/guides/switching/early-termination-fees","title":"How to cancel broadband without paying early termination fees"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/guides/switching/moving-house","category":"switching"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
