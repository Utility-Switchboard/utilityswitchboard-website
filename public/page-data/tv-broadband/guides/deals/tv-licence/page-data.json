This is called a TV licence.</p>\n\n<p>The licence fee is used to fund public servicing broadcasters (namely the BBC) to create and broadcast shows for audiences to enjoy live without funding from advertisements. While you need a TV licence to watch live TV on all channels, many still rely on the funds from advertising or subscriptions to continue broadcasting.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"do-i-need-one\">Do I need a TV licence?</h2>\n\n<p>The law says that you need to be covered by a TV licence to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Watch and record programmes as they’re being shown on any TV channel</li>\n<li>Watch and stream programmes live on an online TV service (such as ITV Hub, All 4, etc)</li>\n<li>Download or watch any programmes on BBC iPlayer, even if you’re not watching live</li></ul>\n\n<p>You only need one licence per household, even if you watch on multiple devices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"live-tv\">If you watch live TV</h3>\n\n<p>You will need a TV licence.</p>\n\n<p>According to TV Licensing, live TV means:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Any programme you watch or record as it’s being shown on TV or live on any online TV service. It’s not just events like sports, news, and music. It covers all programmes on any channel, including soaps, series, documentaries, and even movies.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Watching repeats and shows on +1, +2, and +24 channels also count as live TV, as does watching on a delay and Red Button services.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"netflix\">If you watch Netflix and similar streaming services</h3>\n\n<p>You might need a TV licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you watch these services exclusively, without watching live TV, you won’t need one. This is because you aren’t watching live TV and these services are mainly funded by customer subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>However, you’ll still need one to cover any live TV you watch or download.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"now-tv\">If you watch NOW TV</h3>\n\n<p>You might need a TV licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you exclusively watch the on-demand and catch-up services on NOW TV, you won’t need a TV licence. If you watch any live shows, movies, or sports events, you’ll need to be covered by a licence.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"/tv-broadband/providers/now-broadband/tv\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Watch NOW TV</a></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"online\">If you watch TV online</h3>\n\n<p>You might need a TV licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you watch anything on BBC iPlayer, you’ll need a TV licence. Even if you’re not watching live, you’ll need to be covered by one as the licences almost completely fund the BBC.</p>\n\n<p>If you watch live shows on other catch-up services (eg. ITV Hub, All 4, etc), you’ll need a licence. If you start watching a programme from the beginning while it’s still being aired on TV, this also counts as watching live and will need to be covered.</p>\n\n<p>If you only watch on-demand programmes on catch-up services other than BBC iPlayer, you won’t need a TV licence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"no-tv\">If you don’t have a TV</h3>\n\n<p>You might not need a TV licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t have a TV and don’t watch live programmes anywhere else, you won’t need a licence.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t have a TV but watch live shows on other devices, such as your phone, tablet, or PC, you’ll still need to pay for a TV licence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"away\">If you’re away from home</h3>\n\n<p>Your licence covers all of your devices, wherever you are. As long as they’re either not plugged in or plugged in at your own home.</p>\n\n<p>If your device is plugged in somewhere else, that property will need a TV licence to cover you and anyone else watching.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"not-needed\">What to do if you don’t need a TV licence</h2>\n\n<p>If you don’t watch live TV or BBC iPlayer and don’t need a licence, you’ll have to let TV Licensing know.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/cs/no-licence-needed/about.app\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">I don't need a TV licence</a></center>\n\n<p>TV Licensing can check if you’re watching TV without a licence using:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>The national database</b> - TV Licensing has a database of every address with and without a licence. </li>\n<li><b>Visiting officers </b>- If you don’t have a licence, you might get officers visiting to check you have a licence if you need one. All officers have access to the national database.</li>\n<li><b>Detector vans</b> - There are a number of ‘detector vans’ that can detect the use of TV receiving equipment at specifically targeted addresses within minutes.</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"cost\">How much does a TV licence cost?</h2>\n\n<p>In 2021, a TV licence in the UK costs £159 a year for a coloured TV or £53.30 per year for a black and white licence.</p>\n\n<p>You may be able to get special rates on your TV licence if:</p>\n<ul><li>You’re over 75 AND receive Pension Credit (free licence)</li>\n<li>You’re blind or visually impaired (50% off)</li>\n<li>You run a care home or sheltered accommodation (£7.50 per room)</li>\n<li>You run a hotel/hostel/campsite (£159 covers 15 accommodation units. There’s an extra fee if there are more than 15)</li>\n<li>You live in university accommodation, your out-of-term house is covered by a licence, and you don’t watch live TV on any plugged-in devices (free if all 3 are true)</li></ul>\n\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TV-licence-fees-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"TV licence fees 2023\">\n\n<h2 id=\"pay\">How to pay your TV licence</h2>\n\n<p>There are several different ways you can pay for your TV licence:</p>\n<ul><li>Direct debit</li>\n<li>Debit or credit card</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pay-for-your-tv-licence/ways-to-pay/payment-card\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TV Licensing payment card</a></li>\n<li>Bank transfer</li>\n<li>At a PayPoint</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pay-for-your-tv-licence/ways-to-pay/savings-card\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TV Licensing savings card</a></li></ul>\n\n<p>You can either pay in a lump sum or split it into equal monthly or quarterly payments.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/cs/pay-for-your-tv-licence/index.app\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Pay for your TV licence</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"renew\">How to renew your TV licence</h2>\n\n<p>No matter how or when you pay, you’ll have to renew your TV licence every year. If you pay by direct debit, your licence will renew automatically but if you pay any other way you’ll have to renew manually.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest way to renew your licence is through your online account. All you need to renew is your licence or customer number, the surname of the licence holder, and your postcode.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/cs/renew-your-tv-licence/index.app\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Renew your licence</a></center>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can renew your licence by calling 0300 790 6165 or write to:</p>\n<p>TV Licensing<br>\nDarlington<br>\nDL98 1TL</p>\n\n<h2>TV licence login</h2>\n\n<p>The best way to manage your TV licence is through your online account.

Your surname and postcode shouldn’t be tricky to remember, so the issue is probably with your licence number.</p>\n\n<p>You can find this number on your licence, or any emails and letters you’re sent by TV licensing. It will be 10 digits long, made up of numbers. If you pay by direct debit, your licence number might be on your bank statement. It will look like this:</p> \n\n<p></p><center>TV LICENCE 1234567890</center><p></p>\n\n<p>If you still can’t find your licence number, you can use the button below to find it.

You’ll need one if you watch ANY live TV, even if it’s through a streaming or catch-up service.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to cancel your TV licence is by using the <a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/cs/contact-us/question.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> online form</a>. TV Licensing will get back to you, asking for your address and why you’re cancelling to make sure you’re doing so for the right reason. If you pay by direct debit, you’ll also have to cancel this through your bank.</p>\n\n<p>Once your licence has been cancelled, you should fill out a<a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/telling-us-you-dont-need-a-tv-licence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘No Licence Needed’ form</a> to stop letters being sent to the address for 2 years.</p>\n\n<h3>How to get a refund</h3>\n\n<p>You can apply for a refund up to 14 days before the date you no longer need your TV licence. If your licence has already expired, you can apply for a refund if it expired less than 2 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>To receive your refund, you’ll have to fill out the form below and post it to:</p>\n<p>The Refund Centre<br>\nTV Licensing<br>\nDarlington<br>\nDL98 1TL</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/cs/refund/about-the-tv-licence.app\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for a refund</a></center>\n\n<p>Your refund will be calculated based on:</p>\n<ul><li>When your licence was issued</li>\n<li>Your licence’s expiry date</li>\n<li>When you can show you don’t need it from</li></ul>\n\n<p>If your refund is approved, you’ll receive it within 21 days either by cheque or directly into your bank account. Your licence and direct debit will be automatically cancelled.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">What happens to your licence when you move house?</h2>\n\n<p>Your TV licence doesn’t automatically come with you when you move house. You’ll have to let TV Licensing know that you’re moving with your current and new address.</p>\n\n<p>To move your licence, all you have to do is update your address through your online account. You can do this up to 3 months beforehand. You shouldn’t need to cancel your licence unless you no longer need a licence or your new address is already covered by a spouse, family member, or joint tenancy/owner.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact\">Contact TV Licensing</h2>\n\n<p>If you have any other questions and want to contact TV Licensing, you can use the methods below.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone</td>\n        <td>0300 790 6130</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Over 75s</td>\n        <td>0300 790 6117</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/cs/contact-us/question.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Live chat</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/cs/contact-us/index.app#chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Write to</td>\n        <td>Customer Relations<br>\n            TV Licensing<br>\n            Darlington<br>\n            DL98 1TL</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}},"navigation":{"internal":{"content":"{\"What is a TV licence?\":\"#what-is-it\",\"Do you need a TV licence?\":\"#do-i-need-one\",\"I don't need a TV licence\":\"#not-needed\",\"How much does a licence cost?\":\"#cost\",\"How to pay TV licence fees\":\"#pay\",\"How to renew TV licence\":\"#renew\",\"How to cancel TV licence\":\"#cancel\",\"I'm moving house\":\"#new-house\",\"Contact TV Licensing company\":\"#contact\"}"}}},"allContentfulTvBroadbandGuideStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/guides/deals/broadband-speeds-uk","title":"What broadband speeds are available in the UK in 2023?"}},{"node":{"slug":"tv-broadband/guides/deals/line-rental","title":"How to avoid paying for line rental in 2023"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tv-broadband/guides/deals/tv-licence","category":"deals"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
