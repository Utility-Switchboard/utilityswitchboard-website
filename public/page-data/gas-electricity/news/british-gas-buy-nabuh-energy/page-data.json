Ofgem issued them a final order threatening their energy license but, luckily, British Gas stepped in to save the day acquiring its brand and 36,000 customers.</p>\n\n<p>Chris O’Shea, Group Chief Executive at Centrica (which owns British Gas) said: “We’re delighted to welcome both Nabuh Energy customers and our new colleagues.”</p>\n\n<blockquote>“This is a really exciting time for British Gas as we seek to return the business to growth and put customers at the heart of everything we do by offering a competitive and innovative service.”</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"customers\">What does this mean for Nabuh Energy customers?</h2>\n\n<p>While British Gas is taking over the supply, there will be no change to customers as they remain trading as Nabuh Energy.</p>\n\n<p>This means that even though British Gas will be supplying their energy, Nabuh Energy customers will stay on the same tariff at the same prices and still have their account linked with Nabuh Energy.</p>\n\n<p>The main thing that will change for customers is that any debt or payment plans you had with Nabuh Energy will now be paid to British Gas, but you shouldn’t have to do anything to change this.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"when\">When will the changes take place?</h2>\n\n<p>Currently, the final takeover date is 27th April 2021, however, this could change slightly if anything unexpected comes up between the two companies.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t worry, your supply won’t be affected during this time and you won’t even know it’s happened.</p>\n\n<p>Nabuh Energy customers will be contacted in the coming days with all the information you need.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">What if I don’t want to be supplied by British Gas?</h2>\n\n<p>If you don’t want British Gas to supply your energy, you can easily switch to another supplier and, because of the takeover, you won’t have to pay any exit fees.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that it normally takes around 21 days to complete the switch, so to completely avoid being supplied by British Gas, you’ll have to start the switching process by 6th April 2021. If you switch after that date, you still won’t have to pay any exit fees, but you might be supplied by British Gas for a bit through the process.</p>"}},"navigation":{"internal":{"content":"{\"What happened?\":\"#what-happened\",\"When will changes take place?\":\"#when\",\"What if I don't want British Gas\":\"#switch\",\"What does this mean for Nabuh customers?\":\"#customers\"}"}}},"allContentfulAllProductsNewsStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/news/price-cap-increase-oct-21","title":"Will the energy Price Cap increase your bills from October 2021?"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/news/energy-price-cap-increase-apr-21","title":"What does the Price Cap increase, April 2021 mean for you?"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/news/british-gas-buy-nabuh-energy","category":"gas-electricity"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
