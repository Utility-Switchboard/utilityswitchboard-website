We’ve brought all the important ones into one place to help you out. As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit an ENGIE meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>Submitting meter readings can seem like an endless task and your ENGIE meter reading date comes along too often. But it’s a very important task to make sure you’re being billed correctly for your energy.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll be sent a reminder to submit your readings around the 25th of every month and you have until the 1st for an accurate bill to be sent. If you don’t submit your meter readings for several months, a meter reader will be sent out to do it for you.</p>\n\n<p>There are several ways you can submit your ENGIE meter reading:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Call 0808 164 1088</li>\n<li>Email hello@octopus.energy</li>\n<li>Automatically with your smart meter</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key or card</h2>\n\n<p>It’s easy to lose your top-up key or card, but you’ll want a replacement as soon as possible to stay on supply. Luckily, it’s also an easy process to get a new electricity key or gas card.</p>\n    \n<p>All you have to do is email prepayment@octopus.energy or call 0808 164 1088. They can either send you a new one in the post or you might be able to pick one up from your local PayPoint if you can’t wait. You’ll have to put your new key or card in your meter to activate it before you can top it up.</p>\n    \n<p>Bear in mind you might have to pay extra for each replacement.</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you’re on a prepayment, standard, or economy 7 meter, paying bills and topping up is important to keep your energy supply. There are a number of different ways you can pay your bills:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Direct debit</li>\n    <li>Bank transfer</li>\n    <li>Cheque</li>\n    <li>Credit/debit card</li>\n    <li>PayPoint</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can change your payment method through your online account.</p>\n    \n<p>If you’re struggling to pay your bills, you should email hello@octopus.energy or call 0808 164 1088 to talk about your options. This might include installing a prepayment meter or setting up a payment plan to make sure you don’t fall into too much debt. You can also talk to Citizen’s Advice for impartial advice by calling 0800 240 4420.</p>    \n    \n<p>If there’s something else you’d like to talk about regarding any Engie payments, bills, and topping up, you can call 0808 164 1088.</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>When you move house, you’ll no doubt have 101 things on your mind so we’ve made sorting out your energy provider simple.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>If you’re moving out of a house supplied by Engie, you can let them know you’re moving through your online account or by emailing hello@octopus.energy. This allows them to close your account and make sure you’re not paying for any energy used after you’ve moved.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re moving into a home supplied by Octopus, you should receive a ‘moving in’ card with details about your new energy provider and what you need to do next. Even if you’re planning on switching, Octopus Energy will still be responsible for your energy supply until the switching date so you’ll have to set up an account and pay them for any energy you use until then.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>To report a power cut, you should call the dedicated power cut line on 105. You’ll be put through to your DNO who can find out what’s causing the power cut and get it resolved. If it’s already been reported, they can also give you updates on what’s going on and when your power will be restored.</p>\n\n<p>If you think there’s been a gas leak, you should call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. Open all windows and doors, turn off all gas appliances and supply, and get outside for some fresh air.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it might be a carbon monoxide leak, you should call a doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if no one is feeling unwell. If anyone is feeling unwell, you should <b>call 999</b>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the app</h2>\n\n<p>The app is currently only available for iOS at the moment but is set to be released on Android very soon.</p>\n\n<p>Through the app, you can do everything you can normally do on your online account no matter where you are: submit meter readings, make payments, monitor your energy usage, and more.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/octopusenergy/id1093452209\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n\n<p>If you have an Android phone, you can still add your account to your home screen. When you sign in through Chrome on your Android device, a prompt will come up asking if you want to, simply click yes and you can do everything iOS users can do, without taking up as much space on your hard drive.</p>\n\n<p>Octopus Energy also has an open API for DIY developers to use to make their own apps. Because of this, there is a huge range of unofficial apps created by customers to help improve their homes and yours.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">More about the Octopus Agile API</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaints\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>Although ENGIE’s residential complaints have diminished since their customers were bought by Octopus, that doesn’t mean nothing goes wrong at all.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to make a complaint, you can do so by emailing issueresolution@octopus.energy or write to:</p>\n\n<p>Octopus Energy Ltd<br>\n2nd Floor<br>\nUK House<br>\n164-182 Oxford Street<br>\nLondon<br>\nW1D 1NN</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve made your complaint, if you’re not happy with how it was handled, you can take your complaint straight to the CEO by emailing greg@octopus.energy with your account number, contact details, and how your problem has been handled so far. He’ll likely have more resources to get your problem sorted more efficiently.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>As part of Octopus Energy, ENGIE is now able to offer the Warm Home Discount to its eligible customers. If you’re eligible, you could receive a one-off payment of £140 to cover your energy bills from September to March, allowing you to keep the heating on more over the winter months.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta] \n\n<p>To be eligible for the scheme, you’ll be receiving certain benefits and support and will be placed into one of two groups.</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>The core group</b> – If you receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit, you’ll be in the core group. You won’t have to do anything to receive the discount as you’ll be entered into the scheme automatically by the Department of Work and Pensions. You’ll be sent a letter telling you about the scheme and if there’s anything else you need to do (there shouldn’t be).</li>\n<li><b>The broader group</b> – The criteria for the broader group varies by provider. To be eligible for this group, you’ll have to receive certain other benefits and support decided by each provider. If you’re in this group, you’ll have to apply for the discount every year as there is only a limited number available. These are given out on a first-come, first-served basis and the application window normally opens in the Autumn.</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"http://octopus.energy/dashboard/get-warm-home-discount\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">I want to talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If your question or problem hasn’t been covered here, there are other ways you can contact ENGIE and Octopus Energy.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Customer service (residential)</td>\n        <td>0808 164 1088</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Customer service (business)</td>\n        <td>0800 999 5080</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email (residential)</td>\n        <td>hello@octopus.energy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email (business)</td>\n        <td>directsales@engie.com</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/engie/contact","provider":"Engie"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
