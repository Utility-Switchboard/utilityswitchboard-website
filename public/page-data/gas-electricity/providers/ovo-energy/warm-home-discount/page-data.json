Different energy providers have different eligibility criteria, so keep reading to find out more and if you’re eligible for this year’s OVO Warm Home Discount.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is the Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n    <p>Everyone’s energy usage increases over the winter as we start to stay indoors more with the heating on. With the Warm Home Discount, OVO will work with the Government to help cover some of these costs in an attempt to end fuel poverty.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you’re eligible, you’ll receive a one-off payment of £140 to go towards your electricity bill. It covers September-March and is paid straight into your account or used as a voucher if you have a prepayment meter.</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"am-i-eligible\">Eligibility criteria</h2>\n\n    <p>There are two ways to qualify for the OVO Warm Home Discount: if you get the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit or certain benefits. Depending on your eligibility, you’ll be put into one of two groups. These groups are called the ‘core’ and ‘broader’ groups.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n        <h3>Core group eligibility</h3>\n\n<p>To qualify for the core group, you’ll be receiving the Guarantee Credit element of your Pension Credit. The core group don’t have to apply for the Warm Home Discount – they’ll be enrolled automatically.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group, you’ll have received a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions letting you know that you’ve signed up and if there’s anything else you need to do.</p>\n\n<h3>Broader group eligibility</h3>\n\n<p>Qualifying for the broader group is a lot more difficult as different energy providers have different criteria. You have to be receiving certain benefits in order to be eligible and discounts for the broader group are on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n\n<p>To be in the OVO Energy broader group you should receive <b>one of the following</b></p>\n\n<ul><li>Income Support or Income-based Jobseekers Allowance</li>\n    <li>Income Related Employment and Support Allowance which includes a support or activity component</li></ul>\n\n<p>As well as <b>one of the following</b>:</p>\n\n<ul><li>You are responsible for a child under 18 who is in full-time education</li>\n<li>You are exempt from NHS prescription charges due to illness, pregnancy, or a MATAX/MEDEX certificate</li>\n<li>You receive Child Tax Credit which includes a disability or severe disability element</li>\n<li>You receive a disabled child premium</li>\n<li>You receive a disability, enhanced disability, or severe disability premium</li>\n<li>You receive War Disablement pension</li>\n<li>You receive Industrial Injuries Benefit</li>\n<li>You have a child who’s registered disabled</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or, you receive:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Universal Credit with a monthly household income below £1,349 (before tax and reductions)<b>and one of the following</b>:</li>\n<ul><li>Are responsible for a child under 5 who lives with you</li>\n<li>Are responsible for a child under 18 who is in full-time education</li>\n<li>Get the housing element of Universal Credit</li>\n<li>Get the limited capability for work element of Universal Credit</li>\n<li>Get the disabled child premium of Universal Credit</li>\n<li>Have a child who is registered disabled</li>\n<li>Are registered disabled or receive DLA or PIP</li>\n<li>Are exempt from NHS prescription charges due to illness, pregnancy, or MATAX/MEDEX certificates</li>\n<li>You receive War Disablement pension</li>\n<li>You receive Industrial Injuries Benefit</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Recieve Universal credit and don’t work or are self-employed <b>and one of the following</b>:</li>\n<ul><li>Are responsible for a child under 5 who lives with you</li>\n<li>Are responsible for a child under 18 in full-time education</li>\n<li>Receive the housing element of Universal Credit</li>\n<li>Get the limited capability for work element of Universal Credit</li>\n<li>Get the disabled child element of Universal Credit</li>\n<li>Have a child who’s registered disabled</li>\n<li>Are registered disabled or receive DLA or PIP</li>\n<li>Receive Child Tax Credit which includes a disability or severe disability element for a child under 18</li>\n<li>Receive a disability, enhanced disability, or severe disability premium</li>\n<li>Receive a pensioner, higher pensioner, or enhanced pensioner premium</li>\n<li>Receive War Disablement pension</li>\n<li>Receive Industrial Injuries Benefit</li>\n</ul></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"which-group\">Which group are you in?</h2>\n\n<p>Choose which group you think you’re in and find out more about how to apply.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standard-container\">\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#core-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt1\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-hands\"></i>\n                <h3>Core group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you automatically receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#broader-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt2\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-clipboard-list\"></i>\n                <h3>Broader group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you you'll need to apply to receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-group\">Claim OVO Energy Warm Home Discount in the core group</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group, you should receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions by December 2020 letting you know. You shouldn’t have to do anything to claim the discount; it will be sent to your account automatically.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you’re in the core group and haven’t received a letter, you should call the Warm Home Discount Scheme helpline on 0800 917 1003 before 28th February 2021 to ensure you receive your discount.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve received a letter but no payment by 31st March 2021, have a look at the reference number on your letter – you might have to provide the Department of Work and Pensions a few extra details.</p>\n\n<p><b>If your reference number starts with an ‘M’</b></p>\n\n<p>You shouldn’t have to do anything. Your discount will be sent straight into your account or a voucher sent in the post automatically. If it’s not, you can call the Warm Home Discount helpline on 0800 917 1003.</p>\n\n<p><b>If your reference number starts with a ‘U’</b></p>\n\n<p>The Department of Work and Pensions doesn’t know your electricity provider.

Discounts for this group are limited, so make sure you apply as soon as possible so you don’t miss out.</p>\n\n<p>The application window varies by supplier and the number of discounts left, however, it normally opens in the Autumn and you’ll receive your payment by the end of March. Keep an eye out for this year’s opening and closing dates!</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.ovoenergy.com/warm-home-discount\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-i-switch\">What happens if I switch providers after I’ve applied?</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group, you’ll still receive your discount, even if your new provider doesn’t normally support the scheme. Simply let the DWP know that you’ve switched by calling 0800 917 1003 and the £140 should be in your new electricity account by the end of March.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group, it’s more difficult to switch and keep your Warm Home Discount. If you switch to a provider which doesn’t support the scheme, unfortunately, you’ll lose out. Even if you switch to a provider which does support the scheme, you might still lose out as different providers have different criteria for the broader group.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"worth-it\">Is the Warm Home Discount worth it?</h2>\n\n<p>It may sound like an odd question, but it’s a question with a very different answer than you think. While you can save £140 over the winter, you might be paying for this over the rest of the year. Around 11 million homes across the UK (almost half the country) are on Standard Variable Tariffs, the most expensive providers have to offer. These come with premium rates which help the big energy providers afford to give away so much every year.</p>\n\n<p>If you switched to a provider which doesn’t offer the Warm Home Discount, you might be able to save more than £140 across the whole year, not just during winter.

If you want to make upgrades to your home, OVO could help you fund a new boiler, insulation, double glazing, and more. These could save you a lot of money over the winter as it keeps your home warmer without needing the heating on.</p>        \n        \n        <p>By upgrading to a smart meter, your in-home display can help you see where you can save all year round. Seeing your energy usage in real-time monetary values makes you more conscious of when you’re using a lot of energy and encourages you to cut down.</p>        \n        \n        <p>There’s another Government-led scheme you could apply for called the Affordable Warmth Scheme. This scheme provides funding to cover the cost of installing products which could keep your home warmer and more energy efficient. This could include a new boiler upgrade, free storage heaters, or the installation of wall cavity and loft insulation. Replacing an old boiler with a new energy-efficient ‘A’ rated boiler could save you up to 35% on your heating bills.</p>\n\n        <h2 id=\"contact-the-team\">Contact the Warm Home Discount team</h2>\n\n        <p>To talk to the dedicated Warm Home Discount team, you can get in touch using the details below.
