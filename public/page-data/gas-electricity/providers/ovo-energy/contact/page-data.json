We’ve brought together all the OVO Energy contact numbers you might need to get to the bottom of your problem.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>It’s important to submit your meter readings regularly to make sure you’re paying the right amount for your energy. If you forget, you’ll end up with an estimated bill, which means you could be paying too much or too little for the energy you’re using.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few ways you can contact OVO Energy to submit your meter readings:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Call 0330 303 5063</li>\n<li>Message OVO on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ovoenergy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OVOEnergy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Using their online chat</li>\n<li>Emailing hello@ovoenergy.com</li>\n<li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>If you’re prone to forgetting to submit meter readings, or struggle to read your meter, you could have a smart meter installed. Your smart meter will send your readings automatically at regular intervals.</li></ul>\n\n<p>OVO Energy are currently rolling out second-generation smart meters and have a tariff dedicated to new customers who don’t yet have one installed. It has much lower rates than their other tariffs, saving you up to £119 per year! To find out more, give Utility Switchboard a call on <a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">020 3992 7717</a>.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">I need a new top-up key or card</h2>\n\n    <p>OVO’s prepayment meters have now been passed over to Boost Power, so if anything happens to your key or card, you should <a href=\"/gas-electricity/providers/boost/contact/\"><b>contact Boost</b></a> instead.</p>\n    \n    <p>If you need a replacement, you can call 0330 102 7517 or 0117 332 3728 to talk to Boost. They’ll give you an 8-digit code to take with you to your local PayPoint to pick up your new key or card.</p>    \n    \n    <p>Bear in mind that you might have to pay for your replacement key or card. They normally cost £5 per replacement and will be paid through your top ups.</p>    \n    \n    <p>It will take at least an hour for the reference number to be activated, so keep your reference number written down somewhere safe.</p>    \n    \n    <p>When you have your new key or card, you’ll have to activate it in your meter by putting it in for at least a minute. Don’t top up until it’s been activated or you could lose what you’ve put on already.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n    <p>You can pay your bills and make extra payments through your online account. Whether you’re topping up your smart prepayment meter or paying a bit more to cover extra costs, it’s a super simple process.</p>\n    \n    <ol><li>Log into your My OVO</li>\n    <li>Click on ‘Payments’</li>\n    <li>Choose ‘Make a Payment’</li>\n    <li>Fill in the amount you want to pay</li>\n    <li>Fill out your details and make the payment</li></ol>\n\n    <p>If you want to pay by bank transfer, you should use your OVO account number plus your postcode as the reference (eg. 0123456 + BS16ED) and send it to:</p>   \n    \n    <p>Account number: 83683249<br>    \n    Sort code: 20-00-00</p>\n    \n    \n    <p>You can also pay over the phone by calling either 0330 303 5963 or 01179 303 100. Have your card details ready and a copy of your most recent bill.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"new-house\">OVO Energy home moves</h2>\n\n    <p>If you’re moving house, one of the first things you should be thinking about is sorting out your gas and electricity. We know you’ve got a lot on your mind, so why not leave it with us? Or, if you’d rather, we have all the OVO Energy contact numbers you’ll need to get moving.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n    \n<h3>Can I stay with OVO when moving home?</h3>\n\n        <p>Unfortunately, with OVO, you can’t continue your plan in your new home. Instead, you’ll have to cancel your plan and start a new one. If you’re cancelling your plan because you’re moving, you won’t have to pay any exit fees, as long as you let OVO know when you’re moving house and where you’re moving to.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you have a smart meter, OVO will automatically take your final meter readings and issue you a final bill within 10 days. If you have a traditional meter, you’ll have to submit your final meter readings manually to receive your final bill. You’ll also have to contact OVO to tell them your opening meter readings if you want to stay with them in your new home.</p>        \n        \n        <p>It can take up to 6 weeks to get a final statement from OVO, and an extra week to receive any refunds you’re owed.</p>\n\n        <center><a href=\"https://smartpaym.ovoenergy.com/moving-home\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Tell OVO you're moving</a></center>\n\n    <h3>I want to switch providers in my new home</h3>\n\n        <p>Switching away from OVO in your new home is simple. All you have to do is get in contact with your new provider with your opening meter readings and they’ll take care of the rest.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you’d like to switch to OVO Energy, there are several different tariffs to choose from. All of their tariffs are 100% renewable so switching to OVO isn’t just great for your bank account, it’s also great for the environment.</p>        \n        \n        <p>For just £6 extra per month, you can upgrade to OVO Beyond, another way OVO are giving back to the environment. By providing 100% carbon-neutral gas, OVO Beyond helps you reduce your carbon emissions from your energy to net zero. OVO will also plant trees on your behalf every year you upgrade – so far, OVO Beyond customers have helped plant over 1 million trees in 2,895 different locations.</p>        \n        \n        <p>Find out more about <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/switching/how-switching-works/\"><b>how to switch</b></a> or give Utility Switchboard a call on <a href=\"tel:442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\"><b>020 3992 7717</b></a> for more help.</p>        \n        \n        <p>The switching process normally takes 3-4 weeks, including a 14-day ‘cooling-off’ period where you can change your mind about switching.</p>\n        \n    <h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n        <p>There’s never a good time for a power cut or gas leak, so if you do experience one, you’re going to want it sorted straight away. Not just because it’s inconvenient, but it might also be unsafe.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n            <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.

If you’re eligible, you could receive £140 to go towards your energy bill between September and March.</p>             \n             \n             <p>If you’re eligible, you’ll be put into one of two groups: the core group or the broader group.</p>             \n             \n             <p>If you’re in the core group, you’ll be in receipt of the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit. You won’t have to contact OVO to apply for the discount, you’ll be automatically enrolled and sent a letter to tell you.</p>             \n             \n             <p>If you’re in the broader group, you’ll have to meet certain criteria and receive specific benefits in order to qualify for the Warm Home Discount and will have to apply every year. The criteria varies by provider, so check to see if you’re eligible before you apply.</p>             \n             \n             <p>If you’ve just switched to OVO and have already applied for the discount through your old provider, you’ll have to reapply with OVO. However, you might not meet OVO’s criteria and might miss out. The same goes for switching away from OVO, as long as your new provider offers the scheme.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../warm-home-discount/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">Download the OVO Energy app</h2>\n\n<p>If you have a My OVO online account, you can also access your energy usage and insights on the OVO Energy app.</p>\n\n<p>With the app, you can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Submit meter readings</li>\n<li>See how much energy you’ve used</li>\n<li>View your spending</li>\n<li>Download your statements</li>\n<li>View your account details and tariffs</li>\n<li>Set reminders for your meter readings</li>\n<li>Find OVO Energy contact numbers</li></ul>\n\n<p>Download the app on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovo.energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Play</a> and<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ovo-energy/id626316021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the App Store</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>OVO Energy is consistently praised for its easy and quick complaint resolutions.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways you can make a complaint:</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.ovoenergy.com/feedback#complaintform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td><a href=\"mailto:hello@ovoenergy.com\">hello@ovoenergy.com</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Call</td>\n        <td>0330 303 5063</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Write to...</td>\n        <td>OVO Energy<br>\n            1 Rivergate<br>\n            Temple Quay<br>\n            Bristol<br>\n            BS1 6ED</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">I want to talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you’d like to talk about, you can contact OVO Energy on 0330 303 5063.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use their community forum, where you can ask questions and get answers from other customers and the customer service team.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://forum.ovoenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Join the community forum</a></center>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/ovo-energy/warm-home-discount","category":"warm-home-discount"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/ovo-energy/smart-meter","category":"smart-meter"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/ovo-energy/contact","provider":"OVO Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
