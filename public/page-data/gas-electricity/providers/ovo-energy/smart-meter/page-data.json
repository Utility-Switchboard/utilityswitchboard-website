Here, you can find out more about your smart meter and how to make the most of its benefits. As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is a smart meter?</h2>\n\n<p>Smart meters are just like your normal energy meter, but with so many added benefits! They can help you save money, energy, and time just by sitting in the back of your cupboard.</p>\n\n<p>Your smart meter automatically sends your readings straight to your energy provider so you won’t have to worry about submitting meter readings every month. And it’s not just your energy company who gets to see how much energy you’re using – you’ll receive an in-home display so you can keep an eye on your energy usage in real-time, monetary values. This helps you to understand where your money is going and means you’re more likely to cut back where you can.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a smart prepayment meter, you’ll be able to see how much credit you have left through your in-home display, which you can place wherever you like in your house. This allows you to stay topped up regularly and avoid falling into debt. Many energy providers, like OVO Energy, allow you to top up your meter online or through an app for even easier energy management.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"installation\">How to get a smart meter from OVO Energy</h2>\n\n<p>As a 100% renewable energy provider, OVO Energy is encouraging customers to upgrade their gas and electricity meters to smart meters to help cut down on energy usage and fight climate change.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few ways you can book your smart meter installation:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Through the app</li>\n<li>By calling 0330 303 5063</li></ul>\n\n<p>Once you’ve booked your OVO Energy smart meter installation, you’ll receive an email confirmation letting you know what to do next, and sending reminders as your installation date gets closer.</p>\n\n<p>The installation process is free, however, if you miss your appointment, you may have to pay a fine.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://smart-booking.ovoenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Request a smart meter</a></center>\n\n<h3>The installation process</h3>\n\n<p>Before your engineer comes to install your smart meter, you’ll have to get a few things ready. This helps the upgrade go as smoothly as possible so you can see the benefits sooner.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Make sure someone over 18 will be at home throughout the installation process</li>\n<li>Clear the area around your meter for easy access</li>\n<li>Keep any pets in another room or out of the way</li>\n<li>Let your engineer know if there will be any issues with parking</li></ul>\n\n<p>Installing your meter will take around 1 hour per meter and your gas/electricity supply will need to be turned off for a short period of time (no longer than 30 minutes per meter) while your meter is being changed over.</p>\n\n<p>When the installation is complete, your engineer will walk you through how to use your meter and in-home display. They can also give you tips on how to cut down on your energy usage and become more energy-efficient to save you money with your new smart meter.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reading-meter\">How to read an OVO smart meter</h2>\n\n<p>Smart meter installation started in 2013, so there are many different types on the market today. We’re going to walk you through how to take readings from the most common smart meters OVO Energy has installed for its customers.</p>\n\n<p><b>If your smart meter has a keypad:</b></p>\n\n<p>Press 9 on the keypad. Your gas reading will be the number followed by ‘m3’ and your electricity reading will be the number followed by ‘kWh’.</p>\n\n<p><b>If your smart meter has A and B buttons:</b></p>\n\n<p>Press ‘A’ until your meter reads ‘total act import’ for your electricity reading or until it reads ‘meter index’ for your gas reading.</p>\n\n<p><b>If your smart electricity meter has two buttons:</b></p>\n\n<p>Keep pressing the display button until you reach a number ending in kWh – this is your electricity reading.</p>\n\n<p><b>If your smart electricity meter has three buttons:</b></p>\n\n<p>Press the middle button. Your reading is the number under ‘IMP’.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ihd\">Reading your in-home display (IHD)</h2>\n\n<p>Your in-home display is probably the most useful piece of tech to own when it comes to energy management. When placed in a prominent position, it can make you more aware of the energy you’re using in real-time and how much you’re spending throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>OVO Energy offers two different types of in-home display: the IHD3 and the newer version, IHD6. Your OVO smart meter engineer should show you how to use your in-home display but if you need some help, you can use the images below for some help.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ihd3\">IHD3</h3>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/l3PAlAyy4cfsLFOmnL2w6/d3f86df2bdb598ba468a8f69da76a844/ovo-smart-meter-ihd3.png\" alt=\"IHD3 OVO Energy Smart Meter\" style=\"width: 400px\"></center>\n\n<ol class=\"jumbo-ol\"><li><b>Connectivity indicator</b> – This shows how well your IHD is connected to your smart meter.

This allows you to see when you’re using more energy and helps work out why and how to cut down.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you use your in-home display to view your usage, your online account is an amazing place to look as it even breaks down where your energy is being used. Your energy usage is broken down into 7 categories: Entertainment, Always-On, Refrigeration, Lighting, Cooking, Laundry, and Other. You can view these either as a percentage or a price, but it’s really helpful when you’re looking into where you can cut back.</p>\n\n<p>To view your usage, simply sign in to your online account and click ‘Usage Graphs’.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.ovoenergy.com/login\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">My OVO login</a></center>\n\n<h3>My OVO Energy app</h3>\n\n<p>Through the OVO Energy app, you can view your usage in a simpler view than your online account. Your usage will be shown as a bar chart and you can have graphs set for daily, monthly, or yearly comparison to see how your usage changes.</p>\n\n<p>To view your usage through the app, you should sign in and click ‘Usage’ at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovo.energy&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for Android</a></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ovo-energy/id626316021\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"problems\">Common OVO Energy smart meter problems and how to fix them</h2>\n\n<p>As with any tech, there are a few smart meter problems that regularly come up. Luckily, these are quick and easy to fix most of the time, getting your smart meter back to normal again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why does my OVO Energy smart meter keep beeping?</h3>\n\n<p>A beeping device is enough to make anyone go crazy, and there are a number of different reasons why your smart meter or in-home display might be beeping.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing you should look at is the battery on your in-home display – it may be alerting you of a low battery. The IHD batteries normally last around 4 hours from fully charged to completely flat, so it’s best to keep it plugged in and charging at all times. It uses very little electricity that it won’t make a dent in your energy bill and saves you having to keep plugging and unplugging it.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a smart prepayment meter from OVO Energy (and are now with <a href=\"/gas-electricity/providers/boost/\"><b>Boost</b></a>), the problem could be that you’re running low on credit or your emergency credit is available. Luckily, with a smart prepayment meter, you can top up from the comfort of your home through your online account or the Boost top-up app.</p>\n\n<p>Another common issue could be that your in-home display and smart meter are placed too far apart and have lost connection. For the strongest connection, OVO Energy suggests keeping your in-home display within 15m of your smart meter, which could solve your problem.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve checked all of these, you should call OVO Energy on 0330 303 5063 or email hello@ovoenergy.com. They can give you more ideas of what it could be and/or send out an engineer to fix the problem.</p>\n\n<h3>I have a smart meter – why am I being asked to submit meter readings?</h3>\n\n<p>One of the main benefits of a smart meter is that you no longer have to send meter readings every month. However, if you’re asked to send readings, even if you have a smart meter, you should.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve recently switched to OVO Energy with a first-generation smart meter (SMETS1), it’s likely that your smart meter has gone into ‘dumb mode’. If your meter is in ‘dumb mode’, it will have lost all of its smart features, but your IHD will still work the same. Providers are working on upgrading SMETS1 meters to make them smart again, however, you can request an upgrade from OVO Energy by calling 0330 303 5063 or email hello@ovoenergy.com.</p>\n\n<p>It could also be the case that OVO Energy is struggling to connect to your meter. If this happens, your meter won’t be able to communicate with your provider to send them readings automatically. They might not know about this, so you should call OVO Energy on 0330 303 5063 or email hello@ovoenergy.com so they can sort it for you. If you haven’t been submitting readings, OVO Energy will have sent estimated bills, which you can request be recalculated.</p>\n\n<h3>My in-home display isn’t showing my usage</h3>\n\n<p>Many smart meter owners have reported their IHDs not showing their usage or coming up blank. This might not be as important an issue as some of the others, however, it can still be a pain when it’s not working.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing you should try is switching it off and on again. Try and keep it close to the meter when it’s turned back on for the most likely fix.</p>\n\n<p>If this hasn’t worked, you should contact OVO Energy by calling 0330 303 5063 or email hello@ovoenergy.com to let them know. It could be the case that you need a new display or that it’s simply in need of a firmware update.</p>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/ovo-energy/warm-home-discount","category":"warm-home-discount"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/ovo-energy/contact","category":"contact"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/ovo-energy/smart-meter","provider":"OVO Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
