So, we’ve brought together all the ways you can contact Scottish Power in one place. As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>It’s important that you regularly submit your meter readings to make sure you receive accurate bills. If you don’t submit readings, you could be charged an estimated bill, which is often higher than it should be. However, it could also be lower than it should be, meaning you start racking up debit and an unexpected extra charge on your next accurate bill.</p>\n\n<p>With Scottish Power, you can submit meter readings:</p>\n<ul><li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Through the YourEnergy app</li>\n<li>By calling the automated meter reading service on 0800 027 8000</li>\n<li>Automatically with a smart meter</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"smart-meter\">How to fix your Tonik Energy smart meter</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you have a Tonik Energy or Scottish Power smart meter, you can take advantage of some great features such as automatic meter readings and keeping track of your energy usage in both monetary terms and kWh. However, sometimes things can go wrong and you can lose some of these smart features. Luckily, these are normally an easy fix.</p>\n\n<p>If your in-home display (IHD) is blank, it could be that it’s run out of battery. Luckily this is an easy fix: all you have to do is plug it back into the wall. The battery life of IHDs is quite short (roughly 4 hours) so, if this was the problem, it might be worth keeping it plugged in at all times.</p>\n\n<p>If your IHD is beeping, it could be that it’s lost connection with your meter. Your meter should still send readings automatically, it’s only your IHD that isn’t working. To fix this, try and move it closer to your meter. If this isn’t possible, you might not be able to use the IHD to view your usage. However, you can view your usage through the YourEnergy app, just not in real-time.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an older, first-generation smart meter (SMETS1), it could be that Scottish Power can’t connect to your meter, even if Tonik Energy could. This will put your smart meter in ‘dumb mode’ and you’ll lose all of your smart features. These meters are due an upgrade in the near future that will allow them to communicate more effectively over the SMETS2 network.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re still having problems, you can call 0800 027 0072 or use the Scottish Power live chat option on their website or app.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key/card</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve lost or damaged your top-up key or card or your new Scottish Power ones haven’t arrived yet, you can easily get a replacement the same day. </p>\n\n<p>To get a replacement the same day, all you need to do is contact Scottish Power, which you can do by live chat or through the app. They’ll give you a reference number which you can take to your local Payzone or Post Office where they’ll give you a new key/card. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re happy to wait a bit longer, you can also email contactus@scottishpower.com or contact them through your online account.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that you might have to activate your electricity key or gas card before you can top it up. You can do this by putting your key into the meter for a few seconds.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>Now you’re with Scottish Power, there are a few different ways you can pay your energy bill:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Direct debit</li>\n<li>By card through your online account</li>\n<li>By card on the app</li>\n<li>Call 0800 001 5168</li>\n<li>Bank transfer (sort code: <b>83-07-06</b> account number: <b>00674713</b> using your Scottish Power account number as the reference)</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you have a prepayment meter, you can top up at your local <a href=\"https://storelocator.payzone.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Payzone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Post Office</a>. You can top up any amount from £1.49 of electricity and £5.49 of gas. If you have a smart prepayment meter, you can also top up through your online account.</p>\n\n<h3>Have you had billing issues during the switch to Scottish Power?</h3>\n\n<p>In Scottish Power reviews, many Tonik Energy customers have reported having a range of different billing issues as Scottish Power took over. If you’ve had issues with your bills, there are a few things you can do to rectify the issue.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing you should do is contact Scottish Power. For the fastest response, you can call 0800 027 0072 or use the Scottish Power live chat option through their website or app. The customer service advisor might be able to fix your problem there and then.</p>\n\n<p>Try to keep a record of your conversations with Scottish Power in case you need to take it further or make a complaint.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve had billing issues with Tonik Energy, you shouldn’t have to do anything - it will be handled by Tonik Energy and its administrators. Alternatively, you can bring it back up with Scottish Power so they can get it sorted for you. You can do this by calling the dedicated Tonik Energy contact number 0800 040 7181 or email contactus@scottishpower.com</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>If you were a Tonik Energy customer and are in the process of moving house, Scottish Power should be aware of this and you shouldn’t have to do anything. You might have to set up an account temporarily as they will still be responsible for supplying your energy until you move out.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, you’ll have to contact Scottish Power to let them know you’re moving. You can do this through your online account and you’ll have to let them know:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your account number</li>\n<li>Your MPAN/MPRN</li>\n<li>The date you’re moving out</li>\n<li>The landlord or new occupier’s details (if you know)</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Power cuts and gas leaks are something that needs to be seen to and sorted as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve had a power cut, you should call the dedicated power cut line on 105. They’ll put you through to your Distribution Network Operator (DNO) who is responsible for getting your power back on. If it’s already been reported, this number can give you updates on when the power will be back.</p>\n\n<p>If you suspect a gas leak, you should call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. Open all of the doors and windows to let in some fresh air and turn off your gas supply and any gas-powered appliances.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it might be a carbon monoxide leak, you should also get outside for some fresh air. Even if no one is feeling unwell, you should also call your doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning. If anyone is feeling unwell, call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the YourEnergy app</h2>\n\n<p>The Scottish Power YourEnergy app is designed to help customers to manage their energy usage on the go.</p>\n\n<p>With YourEnergy, you can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Manage your account</li>\n<li>Control your smart home devices</li>\n<li>Find EV charging points</li>\n<li>Change your tariff</li>\n<li>Change your payment options</li>\n<li>View your bills</li>\n<li>View your energy usage</li>\n<li>Submit meter readings</li>\n<li>Contact Scottish Power</li>\n<li>Top up your smart prepayment meter</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.scottishpower&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for Android</a></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/scottishpower-yourenergy/id562202559\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve already made a complaint with Tonik Energy, this will be taken care of by Tonik Energy and its administrators.
