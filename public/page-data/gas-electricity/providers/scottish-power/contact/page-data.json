Without a reading, your bill might be higher than it should because you’ll be charged an estimated amount based on how much energy you’ve used in the past.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy enough to submit meter readings and there are a few ways you can do this:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Download the YourEnergy App</li>\n<li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Call the Scottish Power meter reading phone number: 0800 027 8000 (an automated service)</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you have a prepayment or smart meter, you don’t have to submit meter readings, however, if you do want to, you can contact Scottish Power on 0800 027 8000.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n    <h2 id=\"smart-meter\">How to fix your Scottish Power smart meter</h2>\n\n    <p>If your smart meter isn’t working properly, it can be frustrating that you can’t make the most of its great features any more. The best way to fix it depends entirely on what’s wrong.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If your in-home display is blank, it could be that it’s run out of battery. This is the easiest problem to fix as all you have to do is plug it back into the wall to charge. The battery life on the displays aren’t very long, so it’s usually best to keep it plugged in if you can.</p>\n    \n    <p>If you have an older smart meter from Scottish Power that stopped working when you switched providers, it could be that your new provider doesn’t support your smart meter. Some providers only support the newer SMETS2 smart meters, however, SMETS1 meters are due an upgrade in the near future that will allow them to communicate over the same network as SMETS2 meters which will bring your smart features back.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If neither of these are the problem, you should contact Scottish Power by calling 0800 027 0072. You can also use the live chat feature on the Scottish Power app or their website.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Getting a new Scottish Power gas card or electricity key</h2>\n\n    <p>If you’ve lost or damaged your top-up key/card, there’s no need to worry – you can get a replacement quickly and easily. Even if you’ve lost your key 7 times before, you can get an 8th! If you need one that day, you can pick up your replacement card/key from your local PayPoint or Payzone. You’ll be given a reference number by Scottish Power to take with you when you collect it so that it can be registered to your meter.</p>\n    \n    <p>You can get this reference number through your online account, email, live chat, or by calling 0800 027 0072.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you’ve lost a Scottish Power gas card, you’ll be able to top it up as soon as you collect your new one, however, if it’s an electricity key you’re after, you’ll have to put it in your meter at home before you can put any credit on it.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n    <p>If you pay for your bills through direct debit, you don’t have to worry so much about paying your bills, but what if you pay a different way? How can you make payments?</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you have a prepayment meter, you can either top up through your online account or take your gas card or electricity key to your local PayPoint or Payzone and top up your meter at the shop. Once you’ve put money on your key or card, pop it into the meter to transfer your credit over. You can top up from £1.49 of gas and £5.49 of electricity at a time.</p>\n        \n    <p>If you’re on a different type of meter and want to make a payment, there are more ways you can pay. You can use your online account or YourEnergy app to make a card payment by selecting ‘make a payment’ then ‘one-off payment’. You can either manually input your card details each time or you can save them to your account to make it easier next time.</p>    \n    \n    <p>The dedicated phone line for making payments is 0800 001 5115. Make sure you have your card details and account number on-hand ready to pay your bill. If you want to set up a payment arrangement, call 0800 001 5168.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you’d rather trust your bank to make the payment, you can transfer the money to Scottish Power using the sort code 83-07-06 and account number 00674713. Use your 11-digit Scottish Power account number, which you’ll find on your bill, as the reference name.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Scottish Power billing issues?</h3>\n    \n    <p>A lot of people mention billing issues when talking about Scottish Power.</p>\n    \n    <p>If you’re unfortunate enough to have had billing issues of your own, there are a few things you can do to get the problem resolved.</p>    \n    \n    <p>The first thing you should do is contact Scottish Power directly by calling 0800 027 0072.
