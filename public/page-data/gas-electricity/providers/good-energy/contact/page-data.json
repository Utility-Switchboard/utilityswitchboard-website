If you don’t send readings, you’ll receive an estimated bill rather than an accurate one, meaning you could be paying for more than you’re using.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>There are a number of ways you can submit your Good Energy meter reading:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Automatically through your smart meter</li>\n<li>Through the Good Energy app</li>\n<li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Have a meter reader come out</li>\n<li>Using the link below</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.goodenergy.co.uk/meter-reading/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Submit a meter reading</a></center>\n\n<h3>Submitting Feed-in Tariff readings</h3>\n\n<p>If you generate your own electricity, you might have signed up for a Feed-in Tariff (FiT). Unfortunately, the scheme closed in March 2019, however, you can still sign up for one with Good Energy if you’re on a Feed-in Tariff with another energy provider.</p>\n\n<p>Just like any tariff, you’ll have to submit meter readings, but this is to make sure you’re paid the right amount for the electricity you generate. FiT meter readings should be given every quarter (March, June, September, and December). If you don’t submit readings, any money you’re owed for your electricity will be paid in the next quarter.</p>\n\n<p>You can submit your Feed-in Tariff meter readings using the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.goodenergy.co.uk/meter-reading/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Submit your FiT reading</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key/card</h2>\n\n<p>It’s important to keep an eye on your top-up key and card to make sure you stay on supply. But sometimes things go wrong, whether they get lost or damaged.</p>\n\n<p>If you need a replacement, you should contact Good Energy by calling 0800 254 0000. They’ll give you a reference number to take to your local PayPoint or Payzone and pick up your replacement. If you can’t get to the shop, they can arrange for one to be posted, however, it may take up to three working days to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>If you pick up your replacement from the shop, you might have to go home and activate your new key or card before you can top it up.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>Good Energy encourages customers to pay their bills by direct debit. This is because it makes customers less likely to fall behind on payments, and also uses 94% less carbon than paying by cheque.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can pay:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through the app</li>\n<li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>By bank transfer (sort code: <b>30-91-99</b> account number: <b>00463501</b>)</li>\n<li>By cheque</li>\n<li>By calling 0800 254 0000</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you have a prepayment meter, you can top up at PayPoint, Payzone or the Post Office.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>Sorting out your energy supply is one of the most important things to think about when you move house.

Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n     </div>\n\n<p>To report a power cut, you should call the dedicated power cut line on 105. They’ll put you through to your Distribution Network Operator so you can report the power cut and receive updates. Find out more about what to do in a power cut <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/distribution/power-cut/\"><b>here</b></a>.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s been a gas leak, you should open all doors and windows, and switch off your gas supply and any gas-powered appliances. Go outside for some fresh air and call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it might have been a carbon monoxide leak, you should also call your GP to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if you’re feeling fine.
