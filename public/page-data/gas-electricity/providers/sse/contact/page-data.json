Many people have complained about how long it takes to contact SSE, so we’ve got all the right numbers in the right place to make the process go a little smoother. As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<p>Giving regular meter readings is an important thing to remember so it reflects the right energy usage on your bill. If you forget to give a reading, SSE will still send you a bill, however, it’s likely to be for more than you’re using.</p>\n\n    <p>You can submit your meter readings online, whether you have an online account or not. However, it’s a lot easier to submit your reading through your online account as otherwise, it’s a 7-step process. Because you have to do this regularly, it might be better to register for an online account using your SSE account number to save you time and having to fill out the forms every time.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n        <p>You can also submit meter readings through the SSE app. There are two ways you can do this: you can either take a photo of your meter or submit the readings manually. Once they’ve been submitted, you can see how much you’ve used and spent instantly.</p>\n\n        <p>To take away the hassle of giving meter readings altogether, you can have a smart meter installed for free. Your smart meter will send your readings automatically over a secure network so you don’t have to worry.</p>\n        \n    <h2 id=\"smart-meter\">Why is my SSE smart meter not working?</h2>\n        \n        <p>Having a smart meter that isn’t smart can be extremely annoying, especially when it means having to manually submit meter readings again. There are a number of things that could be wrong with your smart meter, each with a different solution. Here are the answers to the most common problems people have.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If your in-home display isn’t showing anything, it could be that it’s run out of battery. The battery life isn’t very long on these displays, so we recommend keeping them plugged in all the time. They use almost no electricity to keep them running so you’ll still be able to cut back on your energy usage.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you have an older smart meter, it may be the case that it’s not compatible with your provider. Because the new generation of smart meters (SMETS2) use a different network than the older smart meters (SMETS1) to communicate, your provider might not be able to connect to the older network.</p>        \n        \n        <p>The best thing to do if you have problems with your SSE smart meter is to contact SSE who can either walk you through things you can do or send an engineer to fix the problem. You can do this by calling 0345 026 2658 or through their website and app’s live chat feature.</p>\n        \n    <h2 id=\"new-key-card\">How to get a new electricity key or gas card</h2>\n\n        <p>It’s easy to lose track of your electricity key or gas card; it’s happened to the best of us. If you need a new key or card from SSE, all you have to do is call them on 0345 026 7039 and they’ll send you a new one. You might be charged for your replacement though, so keep them safe.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you’re prone to losing them, you might want to download the SSE top-up app. It’s powered by PayPoint so you can top-up your smart meter from your phone without needing your key or card. The only card you’ll need is your payment card. If you’d still prefer to top up in a shop, you can present a barcode from the app to be scanned at the till.</p>\n        \n        <h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n        <p>There are lots of different payment options to choose from when it comes to paying your SSE energy bill.</p>        \n        \n        <p>The easiest way to pay your bill is through a direct debit. Setting up automatic payments to come out means you don’t have to worry about forgetting to pay your bills. Paying a fixed amount each month means that you know exactly how much you’re paying with no surprise bills. Your direct debit payment will be reviewed at least twice a year to make sure you’re paying the right amount. Paying by direct debit, you’ll sometimes get a discount per fuel.</p>        \n        \n        <p>You can also pay through your online account. You can make payments whenever you like and choose how much you’d like to pay each time. You’ll need your payment card details ready and an online account set up.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you’d rather pay when you get your bill, you can pay over the phone by calling 0345 704 5038. It’s an automated line open 24/7. When you pay on receipt of your bill, you can also choose to pay by cheque. You should make it out to ‘SSE’ and write your gas or electricity account number on the back.</p>\n        \n        <p>Send it to:</p>\n        \n        <p>SSE<br>        \n        PO Box 13<br>        \n        Havant<br>        \n        PO9 5JB</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you’d like to pay through your bank without setting up a direct debit, you should use your SSE account number as the reference and send to:</p>\n        \n        <p>Sort code: 57-40-99<br>        \n        Account Number: 99183129</p>        \n        \n        <p>With a prepayment meter, you can top up at your local PayPoint or Post Office with your card/key. If you have a smart meter, you can also pay through the SSE app. Prepayment meters are a great way to pay if you have debt with your energy provider or want to take control of your budget.</p>\n        \n        <h3>I’m struggling to pay my energy bill</h3>\n\n        <p>If you’re having difficulties paying and are on certain benefits, you can set up a Fuel Direct. This is where some of your benefits are paid directly to SSE to pay for your debt and energy usage. Some people find this easier as it means you don’t have to put money aside.</p>        \n        \n        <p>You can also contact SSE on 0345 070 7395 to talk to them directly and they might be able to help you out.</p>\n        \n    <h2 id=\"new-house\">I’m moving house</h2>\n\n    [gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n        <p>If you’re moving out of a home with SSE, you can let them know by filling out <a href=\"https://mymove.sse.co.uk/moveout/postcode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this form</a>. You don’t have to fill out the whole form at once, you can save and come back to it when you have more time or details. Alternatively, you can call 0345 600 2006.</p>\n\n        <p>If you’re moving into a new home which is already with SSE, you can fill out <a href=\"https://mymove.sse.co.uk/moveinonly/postcode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this form</a> to give them your details. If your new house has a prepayment meter, you should call 0345 600 2006.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you want to switch to SSE when you move, you can call 0345 026 7058 or get a quote online. Alternatively, you can give Utility Switchboard a call for help switching on <a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\"><b>020 3992 7717</b></a> and we can do the legwork for you.</p>\n        \n    <h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n        <p>If you’re experiencing a power cut or gas leak, you should be able to get it fixed quickly and easily.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n            <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.

While different areas of the UK will be on a different network, the number will always be the same.</p>\n\n    <p>If you suspect a gas leak, call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. If you think it might be a carbon monoxide gas leak, you should also call a doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning and call 999 if anyone is feeling unwell. Get out of the house as soon as you can for fresh air.</p>\n             \n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the SSE app</h2>\n\n    <p>The SSE app is a great way to manage your energy wherever you are, whenever you like. You can pay and download bills, see your energy usage, and submit your meter readings.</p>             \n             \n    <p>There are two SSE apps you might want to download.</p>             \n             \n    <p>To manage your energy usage on your credit meter, you can download the MySSE app on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mysse/id1403794776\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">App Store</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sse.retail.mysse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Play</a>.
