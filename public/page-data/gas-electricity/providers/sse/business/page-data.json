If you’re eligible, you’ll be contacted by SSE.</p>\n\n<p>If your business has up to nine sites, it will qualify for a SMETS2 meter, the second-generation smart meter. With a SMETS2 meter, your business can benefit from:</p>\n<ul><li>No more meter readings</li>\n<li>100% accurate bills</li>\n<li>Opportunities to improve your energy efficiency and save money</li>\n<li>Online energy management platform, SSE Clarity</li></ul> \n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>If you’re eligible for a smart meter, SSE will get in contact by December 2021 to offer you a free installation appointment. If you’d like one sooner, you can contact SSE by calling 0345 725 2526.</p>\n\n<p>The installation process should take no longer than 2 hours. When you book your appointment, bear in mind that your electricity and/or gas (depending on which is having a smart meter) will need to be turned off for around 30-40 minutes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"pay-bills\">How to pay SSE business energy bills</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll find all the details on how to pay your bills on the back of your invoice.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to pay your SSE business energy bill is by direct debit. It also protects you and your business via the Direct Debit Guarantee and avoids the risk of late payment. When it comes to direct debit, you have two options: budget direct debit (a set amount is taken each month) or variable direct debit (payment will be made in line with your agreed payment terms). </p>\n\n<p>You can set up a direct debit by filling out <a href=\"https://www.sseenergysolutions.co.uk/customer-help-centre/useful-documents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this form</a> and emailing it to business.enquiries@sse.com or post it to:<br>\nSSE Energy Solutions Billing<br>\nNo. 1 Forbury Place<br>\n43 Forbury Road<br>\nReading<br>\nRG1 3JH</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t want to pay by direct debit, you can also pay your bill:</p>\n<ul><li>By bank transfer</li>\n<li>Using a credit/debit card</li>\n<li>By cheque</li>\n<li>At a PayPoint outlet</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.sseenergysolutions.co.uk/bills/pay\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a payment</a></center>\n \n\n<h2 id=\"tariffs\">Which SSE business energy tariffs are available?</h2>\n\n<p>As every business is different, every business has different energy needs.

On top of this, you’ll also have the ability to opt for 100% renewable gas.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re on a flexible plan as a larger business, you have a range of options when it comes to renewable energy. You can choose to have 100% renewable electricity from across the UK, from a named wind farm, or you can buy the power you need directly from a wind farm with a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement.</p>\n\n<p>SSE business tariffs can also be upgraded to 100% renewable gas. However, because 100% renewable gas may not be in all businesses’ budgets, SSE also offers ‘SSE Green Gas’ as an alternative. SSE Green Gas is 25% certified renewable gas and 75% carbon-neutral gas, back by carbon offsets.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tools\">What tools are available to businesses?</h2>\n\n<p>On top of your gas and electricity plan, there are a number of different tools available to make the most of your energy usage and help save you money.</p>\n\n<h3>SSE Clarity</h3>\n\n<p>SSE Clarity is an energy management platform that uses data from your smart or half-hourly meter to help you make sense of how you use your energy. Your data will be used to compile different graphs, charts, and interactive reports that allow you to drill down into different levels of data that you can find through your online account.</p>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/7wFbSilQMHc9UeRibgBOWm/767cf4abfc96d9b3dc7f8f9be258941a/sse-clarity-consumption-report.jpeg\" alt=\"SSE Clarity consumption report\"></center>\n\n<p>SSE Clarity’s reports are divided into two different types:</p>\n<ul><li><b>Interactive reports</b> let you look into different levels of data</li>\n<li><b>Static reports</b> let you view data in fixed formats</li></ul>\n\n<p>Your interactive reports don’t just compare your energy usage over time, you can also see how it changes according to factors such as outside temperature, benchmark data, trading vs non-trading data. They can be used to identify problems and faults as well as where you can cut back on your usage to save money.</p>\n\n<p>To use SSE Clarity, you’ll need to have a smart meter installed and turn on half-hourly readings. You’ll also need to give SSE permission to access and view your meter’s half-hourly data so it can be sent to your online dashboard and compiled into reports.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.sseenergysolutions.co.uk/forms/business-energy/clarity\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Activate SSE Clarity</a></center>\n\n<p>Once you’ve activated SSE Clarity, you can upgrade at any time to SSE Clarity Advanced, which offers a wider range of in-depth analysis and reports suited to management level and Energy Managers. You can do this through your online account or by calling your Account Manager on 0800 072 3317.</p>\n\n<h3>SSE Foresight</h3>\n\n<p>SSE Foresight is a portal designed to help organisations with their energy trading.

You can access both of these through your SSE business online account.</p>\n\n<h3>EV Charging at Work</h3>\n\n<p>With businesses owning over half of all registered vehicles in the UK and the sale of petrol and diesel cars set to end in 2030, workplace EV charging is something all companies should be considering.</p>\n\n<p>SSE EV Charging at Work is a scalable end-to-end EV charging solution designed for your business. Whether you need large charging networks for your business’ vehicles or a few charging points for your employees, you can show your commitment to sustainability and help your staff drive greener.</p>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/Gb4J1NeGn65FxyZkNYIbr/e5b810ab3af682c72ed9f8cbd035459a/sse-ev-chargin-hub.jpeg\" alt=\"SSE EV charging hub\"></center>\n\n<p>Getting started with workplace charging is extremely easy with SSE, and might cost less than you think.
