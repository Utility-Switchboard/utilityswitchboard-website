While not all providers support the Warm Home Discount, SSE is able to offer eligible customers £140 off their energy bills.</b></p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is the Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n    <p>The Warm Home Discount is a scheme which was set up in 2011 to help low-income families and other vulnerable people afford their winter energy bills. Where we all have the heating on and are inside more during the winter, we use a lot more energy than we would in the summer and the Warm Home Discount is a way to keep everyone safe and warm in the colder months.</p>    \n    \n    <p>Eligible customers will be able to receive a one-off payment of £140 to cover part of their energy bills from September-March. It’s paid directly into your electricity account or sent to prepayment customers in the form of a voucher.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"am-i-eligible\">Eligibility criteria</h2>\n\n    <p>If you’re eligible for the Warm Home Discount, you’ll be in one of two groups. These groups are called the ‘core’ and ‘broader’ groups and identify the two types of customers eligible for the scheme.</p>\n    \n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n    \n        <p>The core group will be enrolled and accepted into the scheme automatically, while the broader group will have to apply through SSE. There are only a limited number of discounts for the broader group, so it’s offered on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n\n    <h3>Core group eligibility</h3>\n\n        <p>If you’re in the core group, you’ll be in receipt of the Guarantee Credit element of your Pension Credit. The Department of Work and Pensions will contact you letting you know you’re in this group. You shouldn’t have to do anything else.</p>\n        \n    <h3>Broader group eligibility</h3>\n\n        <p>Different energy providers have different criteria to be eligible for the broader group. You’ll be considered for SSE’s broader group if you:</p>\n        \n        \n    <ul><li>Receive Income Support, income-based Jobseekers’ Allowance, or income-related Employment and Support Allowance <b>and</b>:</li>\n      <ul><li>War disablement pension</li>\n        <li>Incapacity benefits</li>\n        <li>Disabled Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments Receive Carers Allowance for someone who lives with you</li>\n        <li>Receive pensioner premium or disability premium</li>\n        <li>Receive Industrial Injuries benefits</li>\n        <li>Receive Child Disablement benefits</li>\n        <li>Receive Child Tax Credit which includes a disability element</li>\n        <li>Have a child aged 18 or under who is in full-time education</li>\n        <li>Have a child aged 5 or under</li></ul>\n\n<li>Receive Universal credit, (not in work or self-employed) or have earned between £0 and £1349 in at least one month in the past year <b>and</b>:</li>\n            <ul><li>War Disablement Pension</li>\n                <li>Disabled Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments</li>\n                <li> Child Disability Living Allowance</li>\n                <li>A pensioner, disability, or child disability premium</li>\n                <li>Industrial Injuries Benefit Limited Capability for Work element</li>\n                <li>Have a child aged 5 or under</li>\n                <li>Have a child 18 or under who is in full-time education</li>\n                <li>Housing element</li>\n            </ul>   \n<li>Receive Child Tax Credit on an income of £16,190 <b>and</b>:</li>\n            <ul><li>Disabled Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments</li>\n                <li>Child Disability Allowance</li>\n                <li>Have a child aged 5 or under</li>\n                <li>Have a child aged 18 or under who is in full-time education</li>\n                <li>A pensioner, disability, or child disability premium</li>\n                <li>Child Tax Credit which includes a disability element</li>\n            </ul>\n<li>Receive Working Tax Credit<b> and</b>:</li>\n            <ul><li>Disabled Living Allowance or Personal Independent Payments</li>\n                <li>A disability premium</li>\n            </ul>\n<li>Are eligible for free school meals for a child born on or before 1st April 2012.</li></ul>\n        \n        \n        <p>You may be asked for documents as proof to make sure you’re accepted.</p>\n        \n<h2 id=\"which-group\">Which group are you in?</h2>\n\n    <p>Now you know the criteria for each group, click below which one applies to you to find out how to apply.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"standard-container\">\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#core-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt1\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-hands\"></i>\n                <h3>Core group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you automatically receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#broader-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt2\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-clipboard-list\"></i>\n                <h3>Broader group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you you'll need to apply to receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <h3 id=\"core-group\">Claim SSE Warm Home Discount in the core group</h3>\n\n        <p>If you’re in the core group, you shouldn’t have to do anything.

Even if you switch to a provider which doesn’t offer the scheme, as long as you let the Department of Work and Pensions know, you’ll still receive your £140 discount.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you’re in the broader group, you might miss out. You’ll have to reapply with your new provider, but only if they support the scheme too. It’s worth noting that different providers have different criteria for you to be in the broader group, so just because you qualified with SSE, doesn’t mean you will with your new provider.</p>\n        \n        <h2 id=\"worth-it\">Is the Warm Home Discount worth it?</h2>\n\n        <p>Saving £140 on your energy bill over the winter sounds great, but what if there was a way you could save even more all year round?</p>        \n        \n        <p>Around 44% of the country are on Standard Variable Tariffs. These are usually the most expensive tariffs offered by providers and the default you’re switched to when your contract ends or you move into a new home. It’s these premium rates that allow providers like SSE to afford to give so many homes a £140 discount every year.</p>        \n        \n        <p></p>However, if you switched to a different provider, even one which doesn’t offer the Warm Home Discount, you might be able to save even more than £140.

You will have to be over a certain age to receive this payment which, unlike the Warm Home Discount, is sent straight to your bank account if you qualify.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If it’s going to be an unusually cold winter, you might be able to benefit from a <a href=\"https://www.utilityswitchboard.com/gas-electricity/guides/cold-weather-payment\"><b> Cold Weather Payment</b></a>. When the weather is forecast to be 0 degrees or lower for seven consecutive days, you could be entitled to £25 per seven day period. You can get this payment if you’re on certain benefits and runs from November to March every year.</p>        \n        \n        <p>One of the easiest ways to save money on your energy bills would be to use less energy! That might sound hard, especially over the winter months, but it’s a lot easier than you think. By making your home more energy-efficient, you can save a lot more over the year, simply by upgrading your boiler and installing cavity wall and loft insulation. Getting a smart meter could also help with this as it makes you more aware of your energy usage and spending, meaning you’re more likely to cut back.</p>\n        \n    <h2 id=\"contact-the-team\">Contact the Warm Home Discount team</h2>\n\n        <p>To apply for the Warm Home Discount or find out more, you can call or write to the dedicated team at the details below, or you can give Utility Switchboard a call on <b><a href=\"tel:+442039927717\">020 3992 7717</a></b>.</p>\n        \n        <div class=\"standard-container\">\n            <div class=\"col50 hidden-xs\" style=\"height: auto;\">\n                <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1541.6681148871958!2d-2.996327973788887!3d53.79307578025086!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x487b43d0ce20118b%3A0x5beaa5e60d55dad7!2sDWP%20Peel%20Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1615543335348!5m2!1sen!2suk\" style=\"border:0;height: 100%;width:100%\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col50\">\n                <table>\n                    <tbody><tr>\n                        <td class=\"add-box-icon-box\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-phone-alt\"></i>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <p><strong>Telephone: <span style=\"color:#D338AE\">0800 731 0214</span></strong></p>\n                            <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><i>Freephone available Monday to Friday: 8:30am - 4:30pm (Closed bank holidays)</i></p>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr style=\"background-color: #FFF;\">\n                        <td class=\"add-box-icon-box\">\n                            <i class=\"fas fa-envelope-open-text\"></i>\n                        </td>\n                        <td>\n                            <p><strong>By post</strong><br>\n                            Warm Home Discount<br>\n                            Peel Park<br>\n                            Brunel Way<br>\n                            Blackpool<br>\n                            FY4 5ES</p>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                </tbody></table>\n                <br>\n\n            </div>\n        </div>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/sse/business","category":"business"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/sse/contact","category":"contact"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/sse/warm-home-discount","provider":"SSE"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
