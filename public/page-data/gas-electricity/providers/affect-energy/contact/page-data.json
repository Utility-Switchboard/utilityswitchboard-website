If you don’t know how to, we’ve got all the different ways to get in touch. As always, we’ve got you covered.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info warning\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon warning\"></div> <span><h3>Important!</h3> <p>Please note that Affect Energy has now been taken over by Octopus Energy. To find out more about your new provider, visit <b><a href=\"/gas-electricity/providers/octopus-energy/contact/\">this page</a></b>.</p></span>\n   </div>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>Submitting meter readings is an important job, so it’s important you know how to do it. If you don’t submit your readings, you’ll receive an estimated bill, which will likely be higher than it would otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t worry if you’re prone to forget, you’ll receive an email around the 25th of every month reminding you to read your meter and submit your readings. You’ll have until the 1st for it to be used in your invoice. If you don’t submit your reading in that window, you’ll receive an estimated bill instead.</p>\n\n<p>You can submit your meter readings:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>By calling 0808 164 1088</li>\n<li>Email hello@affectenergy.com</li>\n<li>Through a meter reader</li>\n<li>With a smart meter</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>If you don’t send any readings for several months or struggle to read your meter, a meter reader will be sent out to take the reading for you. To make sure that the reader is legitimate, you can ask them for ID and they’ll be from either TMA or Lowri Beck.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key or card</h3>\n\n<p>Affect Energy didn’t support prepayment meters, however, now you’re with Octopus, you might have had one installed. If you’ve lost your key or card, it’s easy to get a replacement.</p>\n\n<p>Simply email prepayment@octopus.energy or call 0808 164 1088. They can either send you a new one in the post or you might be able to pick one up from your local PayPoint. Bear in mind that you might have to pay for a replacement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>While the preferred way to pay Affect Energy was through direct debit, you have a lot more options now that Octopus has taken over.</p>\n\n<p>You can continue paying by direct debit (which is still the preferred method) or you can pay by:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Bank transfer</li>\n<li>Cheque</li>\n<li>Credit/debit card</li>\n<li>PayPoint (even without a prepayment meter)</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can change this through your online account or by calling 0808 164 1088.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a prepayment meter, you can top this up at either a <a href=\"https://consumer.paypoint.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PayPoint</a> or a <a href=\"https://storelocator.payzone.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Payzone</a> store. The most you can top up at once is £49 and you should keep your receipt as proof of purchase in case something goes wrong.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any other questions about paying bills, you can also call Affect Energy on 0330 60 62 675.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>It’s very unlikely that you’ll move into a house supplied by Affect Energy. Not only because they’re now owned by Octopus, but also because they had very few customers to start off with. In the unlikely event that you do, you’ll still have to contact Affect Energy to let them know, even if you’re already with either company.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the Affect Energy contact number: 0330 60 62 675 or email help@affectenergy.com</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>When you move into a new home supplied by either Affect Energy or Octopus Energy, you’ll receive a ‘move-in’ card in the post. This tells you how you can set up a new account, which you’ll need to do even if you want to switch to a new provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t receive a ‘move-in’ card, email hello@octopus.energy with your:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Name</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Phone number</li>\n<li>Move-in date</li>\n<li>Opening meter readings</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you’ve had a power cut, you should call your Distribution Network Operator (DNO) on 105.</p>\n\n<p>If you suspect a gas leak, you should open all the windows and doors, turn off your gas supply, get outside for some fresh air, and call 0800 111 999.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you might have a carbon monoxide leak, you need to get out of the house as soon as possible. Even if you’re feeling fine, you should call a doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning as it’s a very deadly gas, even in small doses. If anyone is feeling unwell, call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the app</h2>\n\n<p>Affect Energy didn’t have an app for their energy, mainly because they hadn’t set up smart meters. However, Octopus Energy have plenty to choose from! Because they’ve left their API open, customers can create their own Octopus Energy apps with extra features and controls.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the Octopus Energy app only available on iOS at the moment, however, Android users can add their account to their home screen to do all the same things without using up any space! When you sign in to your account through Chrome on Android, an automated message will come up asking if you’d like to do so.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/octopusenergy/id1093452209\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>As a small provider, Affect Energy hasn’t offered the Warm Home Discount in the past, but customers can now apply for the scheme through Octopus Energy.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>The Warm Home Discount aims to help low-income and vulnerable households afford their energy bills over the winter. If you’re eligible for the discount, you’ll be placed in one of two groups: the core group or the broader group.</p>\n\n<p>The core group is for vulnerable customers who receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit. These customers will be enrolled in the scheme automatically and will receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions telling them if there’s anything else they need to do (there shouldn’t be).</p>\n\n<p>The broader group is for households on a low income who receive certain benefits and support. The criteria for this group varies depending on the provider and you’ll have to apply every year.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"/gas-electricity/providers/octopus-energy/warm-home-discount/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">Switching to Affect Energy</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you can no longer switch to Affect Energy. However, switching to their parent company, Octopus Energy, is easy and a popular choice at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, 100% renewable energy providers are increasingly popular. Octopus Energy is one of the biggest renewable energy providers at the moment and consistently receives high praise and reviews. As they take on more and more customers and buying providers like Affect Energy, they’ve grown immensely since they first started in 2016.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to talk about something else, you can contact either Affect Energy or Octopus Energy, depending on your query.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Affect Energy</th>\n        <th>Octopus Energy</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone</td>\n        <td>0330 60 62 675</td>\n        <td>0808 164 1088</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td>help@affectenergy.com</td>\n        <td>hello@octopus.energy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/affectenergy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/octopusenergy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/affectenergy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@affectenergy</a></td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/octopus_energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@octopus_energy</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/affect-energy/contact","provider":"Affect Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
