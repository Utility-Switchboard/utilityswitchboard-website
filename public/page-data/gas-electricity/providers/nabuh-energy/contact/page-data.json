Submitting meter readings regularly avoids estimated bills and makes sure you’re being billed for the right amount of energy so you’re not paying for more or less energy than you’re using.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>The best way to do submit readings is through your smart meter, which will send them automatically at regular intervals, however, you can also send your readings over the phone by calling 0330 0414 902 or online using the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.nabuhenergy.co.uk/submit-your-meter-readings-online/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Submit your meter readings</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new key or card</h2>\n\n<p>Losing your electricity key or gas card and losing supply is a prepayment customer’s worst nightmare. Luckily, it’s really easy to get a replacement before that happens.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is contact Nabuh Energy’s customer service by calling 0330 0414 902 and ask for a new one. Your replacement key or card will be sent by 1st class post on the same day so you won’t be without a top-up for long. Then all you have to do is put it in your meter to activate it and you’re ready to top up again.</p>\n\n<p>If you need a new electricity key sooner than that, you can also request to pick one up from your local PayPoint store. The customer service member will give you a code to take to a PayPoint where they can issue your new key. You’ll have to go home and activate it before you can top it up.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a smart meter and want a replacement smart card, you can order this online using the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.nabuhenergy.co.uk/card-request/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Get a new smart card</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re a non-prepayment customer, you only have one choice when paying your energy bills to Nabuh Energy: direct debit.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you are a prepayment customer, there are a number of different ways you can top up:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://consumer.paypoint.com/cashout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PayPoint</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Post Office</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://nabuhweb.mysecurepay.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Online</a></li>\n    <li>Through the app</li>\n    <li>By calling 0330 0082 138</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you’d like to talk to Nabuh Energy about any other billing problems and queries, you can call them on 0330 0414 902 or email billingqueries@nabuhenergy.co.uk</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>Moving house can be a stressful time for anyone. It’s important that you let your energy provider know that you’re moving in or moving out to make sure you’re billed for the energy you use rather than the old/new occupiers’.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>If you’re moving into a house supplier by Nabuh Energy, you should be sent a welcome letter inviting you to sign up. Even if you’re planning on switching providers, you’ll have to set up an account as you’ll still be responsible for paying Nabuh Energy until the switching date.</p>\n\n<p>If Nabuh Energy supplies your new home, you’ll likely have a prepayment meter, meaning you’ll have to top up to stay on supply. You can ask Nabuh Energy to change your meter to a credit meter if you’d prefer, however, you might be charged for this or have to pay a deposit.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re moving out of a house supplied by Nabuh Energy, you’ll have to let them know to make sure you aren’t paying for any energy you’re not using. If you’re on a direct debit tariff, you’ll have to send them your closing meter readings and your new contact details so they can send you your final bill.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.nabuhenergy.co.uk/moving-in/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move house with Nabuh Energy</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">Report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n     </div>\n\n<p>If there’s been a power cut, you should call the dedicated power cut line on 105. They’ll put you through to your Distribution Network Operator (DNO) who can find out what’s happened and restore the power. If it’s already been reported, they can also give you updates or you can keep an eye on it on your DNO’s website.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s been a gas leak, you should call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. Turn off your gas appliances and supply and open all the doors and windows to allow better airflow through the house and go outside for some fresh air.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it might have been a carbon monoxide leak, you should also call a doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if everyone’s feeling fine. If anyone is feeling unwell, you should <b>call 999</b>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the Nabuh Energy app</h2>\n\n<p>The Nabuh Energy app is great for those with a smart meter as it allows you to manage your energy wherever you are.</p>\n\n<p>Through the app you can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>View your balance</li>\n<li>Top up</li>\n<li>View your energy usage</li>\n<li>Track top-up history</li>\n<li>View bills</li>\n<li>Update contact details</li></ul>\n\n<p>All you need to sign up for the app is your account number, postcode, house number, and a compatible device.
