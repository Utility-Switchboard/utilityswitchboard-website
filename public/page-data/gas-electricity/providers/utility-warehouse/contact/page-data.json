That’s why we’ve brought together all the methods you can contact Utility Warehouse into one place. As always, we’ve got you covered!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-readings\">Submit Utility Warehouse meter readings</h2>\n\n<p>It’s important to submit your meter readings regularly to make sure you’re not sent an estimated bill and are only paying for the energy you’ve actually used.</p>\n\n<p>Utility Warehouse meter readings should be sent on the last day of the month if you want to receive an accurate bill. The easiest way to manually send meter readings is through your online account but you can also submit them by calling 0333 777 0777.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://uw.co.uk/clubhouse/meterReading/quicklinks\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Submit meter readings</a></center>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can have a smart meter installed which will send your readings automatically at dedicated intervals so you don’t have to. This ensures that your bill will be 100% accurate and comes with so many more benefits too, including money off your bills.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key or card</h2>\n\n    <p>It’s easy to put down your electricity key or gas card and forget where you’ve put it next time you go to top up. But if it’s completely disappeared or been damaged, you can easily get a new one.</p>    \n    \n    <p>All you have to do is contact Utility Warehouse on 0333 777 0777 to ask for a replacement. Your new key or card will be sent in the post, however, it can take up to 5 days to get to you. If you don’t think your credit will last you that long, you can talk to the customer service advisor about what you can do until your replacement arrives.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you need a new electricity key, you might be able to pick one up from your local PayPoint or Payzone. When you call, the customer service advisor will give you an 8-digit reference number to take with you to pick up your key.</p>    \n    \n    <p>Bear in mind that you’ll have to activate your new key or card by putting it back in the meter BEFORE you can top it up and might have to pay for the replacement.</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n    <p> are a number of different ways you can pay your bills with Utility Warehouse. The most common way to pay is by direct debit, however, you can also make payments by:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Your online account</li>\n    <li>The app</li>\n    <li>Calling 0333 777 0777</li>\n    <li>Bank transfer (account number: 80256684 sort code: 20-00-00) using your Utility Warehouse account number as a reference</li>\n    <li>Cheque (write your Utility Warehouse account number on the back)</li></ul>\n\n    <p>To change the way you pay, all you have to do is contact Utility Warehouse on 0333 777 0777 and they can help you out.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you have a prepayment meter, you can top up your meter at your local:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li><a href=\"https://consumer.paypoint.com/cashout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PayPoint</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"https://storelocator.payzone.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Payzone</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"https://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Post Office</a></li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n    <p>Moving into a new home comes with all kinds of different problems and bills to sort out.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If Utility Warehouse is your current supplier, you’ll have to let them know you’re moving at least 2 working days before your moving day so that they can close your account and produce a final bill. You can do this through your online account or by calling 0333 777 0777.</p>    \n    \n    <p>When you let them know you’re moving, you’ll have to let them know:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Your account number</li>\n    <li>Your MPAN/MPRN</li>\n    <li>Your new address</li>\n    <li>Your move-in date</li>\n    <li>Your closing meter readings</li>\n    <li>Whether or not you want your new home to be supplied by Utility Warehouse</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>If you’ve just moved into a house supplied by Utility Warehouse, you’ll have to call them on 0333 777 0777, even if you’re planning on switching providers. This is because they’ll still supply your energy until the final switch date so you’ll have to pay them for any energy you use.</p>\n\n<p>When you call, you should give them your opening meter readings to make sure that you’re only paying for your own energy usage.</p>\n        \n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.

If anyone is feeling unwell, <b>call 999</b>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the app</h2>\n\n<p>In a busy world, being able to manage everything on the go is a must.

It’s aimed to help low-income and vulnerable households to be able to afford their higher energy bills over the winter and to help end fuel poverty.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>There are two groups of people eligible for the Warm Home Discount called the ‘core’ group and the ‘broader’ group. Which group you’re in depends on your circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If you receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit, you’ll be a part of the core group. Those in the core group will be entered and accepted into the scheme automatically. You’ll receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions letting you know and if there’s anything else you need to do (there shouldn’t be). The £140 discount will be added to your electricity account automatically.</p>\n\n<p>If you receive certain other benefits and support, you could be in the broader group. Which support and benefits you have to receive to be eligible for this group vary by provider and you might have to show proof that you receive them. People in the broader group will have to apply for the Warm Home Discount every year as there are only a limited number of discounts available. Applications normally open in the Autumn and discounts are given on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://uw.co.uk/clubhouse/warmhome/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, there is only one Utility Warehouse contact number for all queries and departments: 0333 777 0777.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you don’t feel like being on hold and passed through different departments, you can also fill out their online form and they’ll get back to you.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://uw.co.uk/help/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Utility Warehouse contact form</a></center>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/utility-warehouse/contact","provider":"Utility Warehouse"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
