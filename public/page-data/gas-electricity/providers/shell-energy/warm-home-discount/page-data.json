The scheme was set up in 2011 by the Government to help end fuel poverty in the UK and allow low-income and vulnerable households to afford their high winter energy bills. Keep reading to find out if you’re eligible for the Shell Warm Home Discount and how to apply. As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is the Shell Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n<p>The Warm Home Discount is a Government-led initiative to help low-income and vulnerable households with their winter energy bills. We all use more energy in the winter, whether that’s with the heating on more or just having the lights on for longer. The Warm Home Discount offers a £140 one-off payment to put towards your energy bills from September to March if you’re eligible.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"am-i-eligible\">Eligibility criteria</h2>\n\n<p>To be eligible for the Shell Warm Home Discount, you have to meet certain criteria. Depending on the reason you’re eligible, you’ll be placed into one of two groups – the core group or the broader group.</p>\n\n<h3>Core group eligibility</h3>\n\n<p>You’ll be in the core group if you receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group, you’ll be enrolled in the scheme automatically and shouldn’t have to do anything. You’ll receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) telling you more about the scheme and if there’s any more information from you.</p>\n\n<h3>Broader group eligibility</h3>\n\n<p>The broader group is for those who receive certain other benefits and support. The criteria for the broader group varies by provider and can even be different every year. There are only a limited number of discounts available for the broader group and you’ll have to apply every year.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>To be eligible for the Shell Warm Home Discount, you will:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Receive the ONLY Savings Credit element of Pension Credit (receiving the Guarantee Credit element puts you in the core group) or...</li>\n<li>Receive income support, Employment and Support Allowance which contains a work-related support component, or Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and one of the following:</li>\n\n<ul><li>Have a child under 5 who lives with you</li>\n<li>Have a child under 18 in full-time education who lives with you</li>\n<li>Receive work-related or support components to your Employment and Support Allowance (or Universal Credit Equivalent)</li>\n<li>Receive disability, enhanced disability, or severe disability premium</li>\n<li>Receive a carer’s premium</li>\n<li>Receive pensioner, higher pensioner, or enhanced pensioner premium</li></ul></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Receive Universal Credit and have earned less than £1,350 in at least one month in the last 12 months or...</li>\n<li>Are not in work or are self-employed earning less than £16,190 per year and one of the following:</li>\n\n<ul><li>Receive the limited capability for work element, with or without a work-related activity element</li>\n<li>Receive the disabled child element</li>\n<li>Have a child under 5 living with you</li>\n<li>Have a child under 18 in full-time education living with you</li></ul></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Your gross annual income is less than £16,190 per year (including benefits, before tax and National Insurance) and one of the following:</li>\n\n<ul><li>Have a child under 5 who lives with you</li>\n<li>Have a child under 18 in full-time education who lives with you</li>\n<li>Are aged 60 or over</li>\n<li>Receive Personal Independence Payments, Disability Living Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, or Attendance Allowance</li>\n<li>Are exempt from NHS prescription charges due to chronic/on-going illness</li>\n<li>Are registered disabled</li>\n<li>Have a mental or physical disability or illness</li></ul></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"which-group\">Which group are you in?</h2>\n\n<p>Now you know the eligibility criteria and which group you fall into, click the relevant one below to find out how to claim.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standard-container\">\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#core-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt1\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-hands\"></i>\n                <h3>Core group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you automatically receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#broader-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt2\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-clipboard-list\"></i>\n                <h3>Broader group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you you'll need to apply to receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-group\">Claim the Shell Energy Warm Home Discount in the core group</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group, you shouldn’t have to do anything to claim your discount. Your £140 will be paid automatically into your account, as long as you’ve received a letter from the DWP telling you that you’re eligible.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you’re in the core group but haven’t received a letter yet, you can call the dedicated Warm Home Discount team on 0800 731 0214 and they can help you out with why you haven’t received your letter. It might just be that it’s been sent to the wrong address by mistake.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve received a letter but haven’t received your payment or it’s overdue, it might just be because you need to clear something up with the DWP. Check the reference number on your letter to find out what’s happening.</p>\n\n<p><b>If your reference number starts with ‘M’…</b></p>\n\n<p>You shouldn’t have to do anything. Your payment will be sent to your account automatically. If you’re still concerned it hasn’t come through, you can call the Warm Home Discount team on 0800 731 0214.</p>\n\n<p><b>If your reference number starts with ‘U’…</b></p>\n\n<p>The reason you haven’t received your payment is that the DWP doesn’t know who your energy provider is. This is a really easy fix: all it takes is a phone call or a letter.</p>\n\n<p>The DWP will need your MPAN and account number (both of which you can find on your electricity bill). You can give them this either by calling 0800 731 0214 or you can write to:</p>\n\n<p>Warm Home Discount<br>\nPeel Park<br>\nBrunel Way<br>\nBlackpool<br>\nFY4 5ES</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"broader-group\">Claim the Shell Energy Warm Home Discount in the broader group</h3>\n\n<p>If you think you’re eligible for the broader group, you’ll have to apply directly every year. Unlike the core group, there is only a limited number of discounts available from each supplier so they’re given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Applications for the Shell Warm Home Discount open in the Autumn, however, the deadline can close early depending on how many discounts are left.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.shellenergywhd.co.uk%20/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Shell Energy Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group, you might be asked for proof of eligibility meaning that it can take a few days to process your application. This is why it’s so important to apply sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-i-switch\">What happens if I switch providers after I’ve applied?</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group, you’ll still be able to receive your discount, even if you switch to a provider which doesn’t usually offer the Warm Home Discount. All you have to do is let the DWP know by calling 0800 731 0214 and the money will be sent to your account as normal.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group, however, you might miss out when you switch. You’ll have to reapply with your new provider (as long as they also offer the Warm Home Discount to the broader group). It’s worth keeping in mind that just because you’re eligible for the Shell Energy Warm Home Discount, that doesn’t mean you’ll be eligible with your new provider. The criteria for this group can vary so it might be worth sticking around until after it’s been paid.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"worth-it\">Is the Warm Home Discount worth it?</h2>\n\n<p>You might think this is a weird question, whether a £140 discount on your energy bills is worth it, but think about it. How can your energy provider afford to give out so many discounts every year?</p>\n\n<p>Around half of the country is on a ‘Standard Variable Tariff’. This is the default tariff your energy provider will put you on once your contract runs out or if you move home. What some people don’t realise is that these tariffs are normally the most expensive and have premium rates.</p>\n\n<p>By keeping an eye on your tariffs and switching provider, you might be able to save more than £140, even by switching to a provider which doesn’t offer the Warm Home Discount.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at the graph below to see what you could be saving:</p>\n\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js\"></script>\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      google.charts.load('current', {packages:['corechart']});\n          google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawStuff);\n    \n            function drawStuff() {\n              var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();\n              data.addColumn('string', 'Country');\n            data.addColumn('number', 'Supplier with no Warm Home Discount');\n              data.addColumn('number', 'With Warm Home Discount applied');\n              data.addColumn('number', 'Warm Home Discount');\n              \n              data.addRows([\n                ['SSE Fix & Control',0, 1063.81,140],\n                ['EON SVT',0, 978.16,140],\n                ['Scottish Power SVT',0, 978.14,140],\n                ['Simplicity 2020 Mushroom',954.13,0,0],\n                ['Green Kelvin', 873.83,0,0]\n              ]);\n    \n             var options = {\n               title: 'Cost of tariffs with & without WHD',\n               isStacked: true,\n               width: '100%',\n               height: 500,\n               NumberFormat: { prefix: '£'},\n               legend: 'none',\n               bar: {groupWidth: '95%'},\n               colors: ['#EAD1DC','#31145B','#EAD1DC'],\n               vAxis: { \n                   gridlines: { count: 4 },\n                   format: '£###.00'\n               }\n             };\n    \n             var chart = new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('number_format_chart'));\n             chart.draw(data, options)};</script>\n       <div id=\"number_format_chart\"></div>\n\n        <p><em>*All quotes made on 05/09/2021 using 3,100 kWh of electricity and 12,500 kWh of gas per year in a London postcode with direct debit payment type.</em></p>\n\n        <p>To switch and save money, call Utility Switchboard on 020 3992 7717.</p>\n        \n        <h2 id=\"ineligible\">How can I keep my energy bills down without the Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n        <p>If you miss out on the Warm Home Discount or aren’t eligible, there are a number of different ways you can save money on your energy bills over the winter and throughout the year.</p>        \n        \n        <p>By investing in more energy-efficient appliances, you could easily cut back on how much energy you’re using. The more efficient your home, the less energy you’re using, the lower your bills will be! Even something as simple as a new boiler or more insulation can create a more energy-efficient environment. If you’re worried you might not be able to afford these upgrades, there are grants available such as the Affordable Warmth and ECO Scheme which can cover either some or all of the cost.</p>        \n        \n        <p>While upgrading to a smart meter won’t automatically save you money, having your in-home display in a prominent place in your house will make you more conscious of your energy usage and habits. Seeing your usage in monetary terms helps you understand where your money is going and can make you more likely to cut down. When you see your desktop PC is costing you 6p per hour while your laptop costs around 1p per day, or your air conditioning costs £1.20 for 12 hours where a fan would cost just 10p, it’s a lot easier to make switches and cut back.</p>\n\n        <center><a href=\"https://www.shellenergy.co.uk/blog/post/energy-consumption-of-household-appliances\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out how much your home could be costing you</a></center>\n        \n        <h2 id=\"contact-the-team\">Contact the Warm Home Discount team</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to talk to the dedicated Warm Home Discount team, you can contact them using the details below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standard-container\">\n    <div class=\"col50 hidden-xs\" style=\"height: auto;\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1541.6681148871958!2d-2.996327973788887!3d53.79307578025086!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x487b43d0ce20118b%3A0x5beaa5e60d55dad7!2sDWP%20Peel%20Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1615543335348!5m2!1sen!2suk\" style=\"border:0;height: 100%;width:100%\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col50\">\n        <table>\n            <tbody><tr>\n                <td class=\"add-box-icon-box\">\n                    <i class=\"fas fa-phone-alt\"></i>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                    <p><strong>Telephone: <span style=\"color:#D338AE\">0800 731 0214</span></strong></p>\n                    <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><i>Freephone available Monday to Friday: 8:30am - 4:30pm (Closed bank holidays)</i></p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr style=\"background-color: #FFF;\">\n                <td class=\"add-box-icon-box\">\n                    <i class=\"fas fa-envelope-open-text\"></i>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                    <p><strong>By post</strong><br>\n                    Warm Home Discount<br>\n                    Peel Park<br>\n                    Brunel Way<br>\n                    Blackpool<br>\n                    FY4 5ES</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody></table>\n        <br>\n\n    </div>\n</div>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/shell-energy/contact","category":"contact"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/shell-energy/warm-home-discount","provider":"Shell Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
