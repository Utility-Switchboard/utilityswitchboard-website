Logging onto your Shell Energy account or the mobile app should bring you to a simple process in order to log your meter reading.</p>\n\n<p><b>Submitting meter readings via Shell Energy ‘My Account’</b></p>\n\n<ol><li>First, login to the Shell Energy <a href=\"https://accounts.shellenergy.co.uk/authn/authenticate/one-login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My Account</a> page</li>\n<li>Click the the third option at the top of the home page: ‘Submit a Reading’.\nChoose which fuel you’ll be sending in a reading for – whether ‘Electricity’, ‘Gas’ or both.</li>\n<li>Enter your reading and date when prompted.</li>\n<li>Once you’re done, click the blue ‘Submit’ button.

Luckily, there are a few easy fixes you can try.</p>\n\n    <p>If the problem is with your IHD, the first thing to check is the battery level. If it’s not plugged in, your in-home displays have roughly 4-6 hours worth of battery life, so it’s usually easier to keep it plugged in to avoid this problem in the future.</p>\n    \n    <p>If you have an older smart meter (SMETS1) and you’ve recently switched to British Gas, it may be that your smart meter has reverted to ‘dumb mode’. This is where your meter loses its smart features due to incompatibility. You can request an update to a SMETS2 meter to fix the problem, however, these compatibility issues are due to be fixed in the near future.</p>\n    \n    <p>If neither of these are the problem, you should contact British Gas through their live chat service or by calling 0333 202 9816. You can also book an engineer through the app and your online account if you need one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top up key/card</h2>\n\n    <p>If you’re missing your gas card or electricity key, it can be easily recovered. Shell Energy customer service is available to help. By contacting them via live chat on their website and selecting ‘Prepayment’ from the given drop down menu, you can get in touch directly to resolve the issue and have a new one sent out.</p>\n    \n    <h3>How to get a new electricity key</h3>\n\n    <p>In order to get a new electricity key, you’ll need to contact Shell Energy directly to get a replacement.</p>    \n    \n    <p>New keys usually take 3-5 working days to be sent out. Unfortunately, if you find your key in the meantime, you won’t be able to use it until you receive your new key.</p>    \n    \n    <p>In order to speak to a Shell Energy representative and order a new key online, follow the link below:</p>\n    \n    <center><a href=\"https://help.shellenergy.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/360001043498-I-ve-lost-my-prepayment-top-up-card-how-do-I-get-a-new-one-?isChatOpen=true\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Order a new key</a></center>\n\n    <h3>How to get a new gas card</h3>\n\n<p>Getting your new gas card is as easy as contacting Shell Energy customer service directly to get this resolved.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately with gas cards (unlike electricity keys) you are able to use the last 2 gas cards to top up; this may be a short term solution while you wait for your new Shell Energy gas card to arrive; provided you still have and can locate your old card(s).</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://help.shellenergy.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/360001043498-I-ve-lost-my-prepayment-top-up-card-how-do-I-get-a-new-one-?isChatOpen=true\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Order a new card</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about my bill(s)</h2>\n\n<p>If you’d like to get in contact with Shell Energy customer services regarding a recent bill or making changes to your account, this is the place for you.

While we always try to ensure all bases are covered, there are always straggling elements we overlook. In order to help the process along, we have some steps for you to take into consideration to make your utility migration to your new home easier with Shell Energy.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>When you move into a new home and also want to take your Shell Energy account with you, make sure that you’ve done the following:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through your Shell Energy account, let them know that you are moving home.</li>\n<li>They’ll send you your final bill within 14 days from when you move out.</li>\n<li>If you are in credit they will refund you, and if you’re in debt they will be taking the last payment which will be awarded within a further 14 days of your final bill being received</li>\n<li>If you’re in debt and usually pay by monthly direct debit, they’ll transfer this to a variable direct debit and have it pay your final bill accordingly. If you usually pay on receipt of bill, they’ll ask for the final payment in full, as per the usual fashion.</li></ul>\n\n<p>To retain your Shell Energy account, you need to notify them during the moving out process that you’d like to stay with them. If you do they will ask you some questions about your new home in order to make the necessary changes. Give your first meter reading within 5 days of re-joining.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re moving in or moving out and are on a prepayment meter, you can call Shell Energy customer service on 0330 094 5800 to give your<a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/meters/mpan/\"><b> MPAN</b></a>or <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/meters/mprn/\"><b>MPRN</b></a> (you can find your MPAN on your electricity bill and MPRN on your gas bill).</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_supply_numbers_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">I want to switch provider or tariff</h2>\n\n<p>If you are considering changing your energy provider in the middle of your contract, note that Shell Energy might charge an exit fee. This can range from £30-£75.</p>\n\n<p>If you decide to change tariffs while still with Shell and you are moving from a fixed tariff, the exit fee will apply. If doing this via your online account, a notification will be displayed during the switching process to make sure you know about this.</p>\n\n<p>You are able to cancel your switch within 14 days of initiating it, though it is not possible to adjust your switch date. This is because it can take 21 days to switch, which is static. The 21 days is inclusive of the 2 weeks you have to cancel.</p>\n\n<p>If in credit with your old supplier, that balance is transferred to your bank account once you’ve received your final bill from them. If you are in debt on the other hand, you must settle your account sooner rather than later as the old supplier may stop your switch from completing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">I want to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<p>Power cuts and gas leaks should be sorted as soon as possible to ensure the safety of you and your family.</p>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.

If you do start to feel unwell, get out of the house for some fresh air and call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">I want to download the Shell Energy app</h2>\n\n<p>As we've seen already, there are many great benefits to downloading the Shell Energy app. Through the app, you can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>View and download bills</li>\n    <li>View your tariff details</li>\n    <li>Submit meter readings</li>\n    <li>Contact Shell</li>\n    <li>View your energy usage</li>\n    <li>Make payments</li></ul>\n\n    <p>You can use the link below to download the app and take control of your energy, wherever you are.</p>\n\n    <center><a href=\"https://www.shellenergy.co.uk/energy/mobile-app\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download the app</a></center>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If something's gone wrong with your energy, it can sometimes be frustrating trying to get to the bottom of things.
