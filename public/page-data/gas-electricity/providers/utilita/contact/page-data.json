You could be charged £6 per replacement card which you’ll pay back with your next top-ups.</p>\n\n<p>You can ask to be sent a new physical card through the post, however, it can take around 8 working days to arrive. If it hasn’t arrived within 10 days, you should call 0330 3337 442. If you need your new card sooner, you can request an eCard which will work straight away.</p>\n\n<p>All you need to request a new card is your postcode and either your meter serial number, customer reference number, BillPay number, or top-up card number.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://utilita.co.uk/help/replacement-cards\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Get a new top-up card</a></center>\n    \n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>Keeping your meter topped up is extremely important if you want to keep your energy supply.

This is important so that you can be refunded any credit you have left on your meter and aren’t paying for someone else’s energy use.</p>\n\n<p>You can let Utilita know you’re moving by calling 0345 2068 777 or by filling out the <a href=\"https://utilita.co.uk/contact/moving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online form</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re switching to Utilita when you move, you might have to agree to a free smart meter installation. However, if you do decide to switch away again, your new smart meters should work with your new provider.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">There’s a power cut or gas leak at my house, what do I do?</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.

If you meet certain criteria, you’ll be categorised into one of two groups: the core group and the broader group.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the <b>core group</b>, you’ll be automatically accepted into the scheme and will have received a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions letting you know. You’ll be receiving the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit and won’t have to do anything to apply.</p>\n    \n<p>If you’re in the <b>broader group</b>, you’ll have to meet certain other criteria. However, due to a high number of applications and a limited number of discounts, even if you meet the criteria and have applied, you might miss out.</p>    \n    \n<p>Utilita opens its applications in August and pays the discount in December and January. If you’re accepted and have a smart prepayment meter, you’ll receive two payments of £70, however, if you don’t yet have a smart meter or pay via direct debit or on receipt of bill, you’ll receive a one-off payment of £140.</p>    \n    \n<p>You can contact the dedicated Warm Home Discount team on 0800 731 0214 or click the button below to find out more.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../warm-home-discount/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Find out more about Utilita's Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">I want to talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>For general enquiries not covered here, you can contact Utilita by calling 0345 207 2000 or using the live chat feature on their website.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d rather talk to someone in person, you can also visit one of Utilita’s energy hubs.
