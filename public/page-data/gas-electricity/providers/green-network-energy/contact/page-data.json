That’s why EDF Energy has made it easy to get a new one.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is fill out the online form and your replacement will be sent in the post. It may take up to 5 days to receive your new key or card, so if you need it sooner, you should call 0333 200 5110 or use the live chat option on the EDF website where they can arrange for you to pick one up.</p>\n\n<p>Your first replacement is free, however, any after that will cost £7.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>If you had a direct debit set up with Green Network Energy, you don’t have to cancel it during the takeover.

You can contact them via WhatsApp at 07480402842 or call 0333 009 6993.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to let them know:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your moving date</li>\n<li>Your opening and closing meter readings</li>\n<li>Your new contact details</li></ul>\n\n<p>It may take a while for you to receive your final bill as they can’t do it until the supply takeover of your home is completed.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>If you’ve moved into a new home, you won’t be supplied by Green Network Energy any more, even if you’ve received a welcome letter from them instead of EDF Energy. You’ll have to contact them and let them know you’re moving in.</p>\n\n<p>If you were with EDF in your old home, you can do this through your online account or the EDF live chat.

Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>If there’s been a power cut, you can call the dedicated power cut line 105. They’ll put you through to your Distribution Network Operator (DNO) who are responsible for restoring the power. You can also use this line to get updates on your power cut, but they will also have a power cut tracker on their website.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s been a gas leak, you should turn off all gas-powered appliances and supply and call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. Open the doors and windows to increase airflow and get outside for some fresh air.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it might be a carbon monoxide leak, you should also call your doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if you’re feeling fine. If anyone does start to feel unwell, <b>call 999</b>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the app</h2>\n\n<p>While the Green Network Energy app was pretty poor, you can now use the EDF app to take control of your energy usage on the go.</p>\n\n<p>Through the app you can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Get reminders for meter readings, top-ups, and appointments</li>\n<li>Give meter readings</li>\n<li>Manage your account</li>\n<li>Change your details</li>\n<li>View your bills and tariff information</li>\n<li>Monitor your energy usage</li>\n<li>Check your account balance</li>\n<li>Make payments</li>\n<li>Contact customer service</li>\n<li>Top up your smart prepayment meter</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edf.mobile\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for Android</a></center>\n<center><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/edf-energy/id404849554?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">How to make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve already made a complaint with Green Network Energy that hasn’t been resolved yet, you’ll have to bring it back up with EDF Energy.
