As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>Submitting meter readings may seem like a chore, but it’s an important task if you want to be sent accurate bills.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to submit your readings to Ecotricity is through either your online account or the app. Alternatively, you could install a smart meter to do and send the readings automatically, without you having to do anything.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n    <p>If you struggle to read your meter, you can call 0345 555 7100 for help and you might be able to have a meter reader come over to take and send your readings for you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key or card</h2>\n\n    <p>It’s not hard to lose track of your electricity key or gas card, or maybe it’s been damaged. There’s no need to stress about getting a new one as Ecotricity have made it simple.</p>    \n    \n    <p>Firstly, you should call 01453 761482. They’ll ask you for your <b><a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/meters/msn/\">Meter Serial Number</a></b> to make sure that the key or card they’re sending you will work in your meter.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you need a new electricity key, you might be able to pick one up from your local PayPoint. You’ll be given an 8-digit code by Ecotricity to give to the person behind the till who can then issue your new key (try and get an EON or Npower-branded key).</p>    \n    \n    <p>They can also send your new key or card in the post, but it may take a few days to get to you. Bear in mind that you’ll have to pay for a replacement.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you have a smart prepayment meter, you’ll never have to worry about losing your key or card again as you can top up from your online account or through the Ecotricity app.</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n    <p>Paying your bills on time makes sure that you don’t lose energy supply or fall into debt with your provider. There are a number of different ways you can pay your bills with Ecotricity:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Direct debit</li>\n    <li>Post Office Payment card (POP)</li>\n    <li>Cash at a PayPoint</li>\n    <li>Bank transfer (sort code: <b>40-14-13</b> account number: <b>62606380</b>)</li>\n    <li>Over the phone (<b>01453 488101</b>)</li>\n    <li>Through your online account or the app</li></ul>\n\n    <p>If you’re struggling to pay your bills, you can call 01453 761 350 and Ecotricity can help walk you through your options. These might include changing to a prepayment meter, setting up a payment plan, or arranging to pay directly through your benefits.</p>\n    \n<p>If there’s something else bill-related you’d like to talk about, you can call 0345 555 7100 or email home@ecotricity.co.uk.</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>Moving home can be stressful, but one of the first things on your mind should be your energy supply. Getting in control of this early makes sure you don’t lose supply or run into any unnecessary debts.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>If you’re moving into a home supplied by Ecotricity already, you should email them at movinghome@ecotricity.co.uk even if you’re planning on switching to set up an account. This is because they’ll still be in charge of your energy supply until your switch date.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to give them your:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Name and contact details</li>\n<li>New address</li>\n<li>Meter Serial Number</li>\n<li>Move-in date</li>\n<li>Opening meter readings</li>\n<li>The name of the letting agents or property manager</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://join.ecotricity.co.uk/moving-in\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move in with Ecotricity</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’re moving out of a home supplied by Ecotricity, you can do this either through your online account or by emailing movinghome@ecotricity.co.uk.</p>\n\n<p>When you contact Ecotricity about moving out, you’ll have to give them your:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Current address</li>\n<li>New address</li>\n<li>Final meter readings</li>\n<li>Meter Serial Number</li>\n<li>Letting agent or property manager</li>\n<li>New occupier</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/forms/moving-out\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move out with Ecotricity</a></center>\n\n<p>If you want to bring Ecotricity with you to your new home, you’ll have to request a new quote. Bear in mind that your new quote may be higher than your current one, even if you’re using the same amount of energy. This is because energy prices can be more or less expensive depending on your location.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.

This is free to call and open 24/7.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s been a gas leak, you should turn off all gas-powered appliances as well as the main gas tap. Open any doors and windows, get outside to a safe place and call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it’s a carbon monoxide leak, you should also call a doctor, even if no one is feeling unwell, to be checked for carbon monoxide poisoning. If anyone is feeling unwell, <b>call 999</b>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the app</h2>\n\n<p>The Ecotricity app is extremely useful for managing your energy on-the-go.

Hopefully, they can sort your problem before it needs to be escalated to a formal complaint.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to make a complaint, you can email complaints@ecotricity.co.uk or call 01453 756111 and someone will investigate your complaint to reach a resolution.

If you qualify for the Warm Home Discount, you could receive £140 to put towards your bills.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>Ecotricity offers the Warm Home Discount to elderly customers who receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit. This is referred to as the ‘core group’.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group, you’ll receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions letting you know that you’re eligible. You’ll be paid your £140 discount automatically and won’t have to apply.</p>\n\n<p>Some providers also offer the discount to a group called the ‘broader group’ who receive certain benefits and support, however, Ecotricity currently doesn’t.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you’d like to talk about, you can use the details below to have your questions answered and problems resolved.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Customer service</td>\n        <td>0345 555 7100</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Landline</td>\n        <td>01453 761482</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>        \n        <td>home@ecotricity.co.uk</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>        \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ecotricity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter        </td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecotricity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/ecotricity/contact","provider":"Ecotricity"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
