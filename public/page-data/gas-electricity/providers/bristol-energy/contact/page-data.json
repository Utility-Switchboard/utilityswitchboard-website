To find out more about your new provider, visit <b><a href=\"/gas-electricity/providers/tonik-energy/contact/\">this page</a></b>.</p></span>\n   </div>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit Bristol Energy meter readings</h2>\n\n<p>While it may seem like a menial task, submitting meter readings to Bristol Energy regularly is important. If you don’t submit meter readings, you’ll receive an estimated bill rather than an accurate one, based on how much energy Bristol Energy thinks you will have used this period. This is often higher than your actual usage meaning that you’re paying more than you should for your energy.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of ways you can submit meter readings through Bristol Energy:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Through the app</li>\n<li>By calling 0808 281 2222</li>\n<li>Email customercare@bristol-energy.co.uk</li>\n<li>Automatically with a smart meter</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new key or card</h2>\n\n    <p>’s important to keep your electricity key and gas card safe so that you can top up easily when you need to. However, sometimes it can be hard to keep track of where you left it or it could have disappeared completely!</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you need a replacement key or card, all you have to do is call Bristol Energy on 0808 281 2222 and they can send you a new one. Bear in mind that you might have to pay for this replacement, even if it’s not lost but faulty.</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"top-up\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n    <p>Paying bills with Bristol Energy is simple and there are loads of different ways to do it:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Direct debit (fixed payments only)</li>\n    <li>Through your online account</li>\n    <li>Through your bank account (Bank: Natwest, Sort code: <b>56-00-05</b>, and account number: <b>27643166</b>)</li>\n    <li>Call 0808 281 2222</li></ul>\n\n    <p>If you have a prepayment meter you can top up at:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li><a href=\"https://consumer.paypoint.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PayPoint</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://storelocator.payzone.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Payzone</a></li>\n    <li>Or call 0808 281 2222</li></ul>\n\n    <p>As a Bristol-based business, Bristol Energy accepts Bristol Pounds as a form of payment. If you want to pay with Bristol Pounds, you’ll have to pay on receipt of bill and do so through your online Bristol Pound account.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n    <p>There are so many things you need to be thinking about when you move house, including switching energy providers.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>When you’re moving out, you’ll have to let Bristol Energy know in advance. You can do this through your online account or by emailing movinghome@bristol-energy.co.uk and tell them:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your name</li>\n<li>Your account number</li>\n<li>Whether you’re a tenant or homeowner</li>\n<li>Your moving date</li>\n<li>Your new address</li>\n<li>Your old address</li>\n<li>An up-to-date meter reading</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you want to bring Bristol Energy with you to your new home, you’ll have to get a new quote, which you can do through Bristol Energy’s website.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://bristol-energy.co.uk/user/login\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move house with Bristol Energy</a></center>\n\n<p>If your new home is supplied by Bristol Energy, you’ll receive a welcome pack in the post asking you to set up an account. You should do this even if you’re planning on switching as Bristol Energy will still be your supplier until the final switch date. You’ll also have to give them your opening meter readings.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to switch energy providers when you move, all you have to do is contact your new provider and they’ll do the work for you. This usually takes around 3 weeks, however, you can start the switching process before you move in so that your new supplier takes over on your move-in date.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n     </div>\n\n<p>If you’re experiencing a power cut or gas leak, you should be able to get it sorted quickly and easily.</p>\n\n<p>To report a power cut, you should call the dedicated power cut helpline on 105. This number will connect you with your <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/distribution/whos-my-dno/\"><b>Distribution Network Operator (DNO)</b></a> who should fix the problem or give you updates if it’s already been reported.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve had a gas leak, you should call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. Switch off all of your gas appliances and open doors and windows.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it might be a carbon monoxide leak, you should get out of the house and call a doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if you’re not feeling unwell. If anyone does start to feel unwell, call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">Download the Bristol Energy app</h2>\n\n<p>Bristol Energy’s BE Connected app is still in its early days, however, there’s a lot you can already do, such as:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Check account balance</li>\n<li>Submit meter readings</li>\n<li>View your bills</li>\n<li>View energy usage</li>\n<li>Change account details</li>\n<li>Compare your energy usage to similar households</li>\n<li>View future energy forecasts</li></ul>\n\n<p>In future updates, you might be able to top up your smart prepayment meter from the app too, but it’s currently still in development.</p>\n\n<p>All you need to use the app is your online account details and an Android or Apple device.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/be-connected-bristol-energy/id1460770750\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.io.eliq.bristol.android\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for Android</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>The Warm Home Discount is a Government-led scheme set up in 2011 to help low-income and vulnerable households to afford their increased energy bills across the winter months. If you’re eligible, you’ll receive a one-off payment of £140 to put towards your energy bills from September to March.</p>\n\n<p>As Bristol Energy is a smaller energy provider, they don’t have to offer the Warm Home Discount. However, they voluntarily offer it to customers in the ‘core group’.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta] \n\n<p>The core group is made up of customers who receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit. If you’re in this group and therefore eligible for the discount, you’ll receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions letting you know. You shouldn’t have to do anything else as they’ll also tell Bristol Energy which customers are eligible.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you’re eligible for the Warm Home Discount’s core group and haven’t received a letter, you can call 0800 731 0214 and the Warm Home Discount team can help you out.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.bristol-energy.co.uk/warm-home-discount\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out more about Bristol Energy's Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you want to talk about, you can use the numbers and links below to contact Bristol Energy.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone number</td>\n        <td>0808 281 2222</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td>customercare@bristol-energy.co.uk</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Bristol-Energy-1629086417353517/?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BristolEnergy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@BristolEnergy</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Write to:</td>\n        <td>Bristol Energy<br>\n            100 Temple Street<br>\n            Bristol<br>\n            BS1 6AG</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/bristol-energy/contact","provider":"Bristol Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
