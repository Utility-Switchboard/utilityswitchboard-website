We hope to make this a little bit easier for you, whether you’re already a Boost customer or considering switching. As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<p>Firstly, what do you want to do?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"smart-meter\">Get a smart meter</h2>\n\n<p>So, you like the look of Boost’s smart prepayment tariffs? We don’t blame you, they come with so many great benefits, such as:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Topping up through the Boost Power app</li>\n<li>Checking your credit wherever you are</li>\n<li>Using one payment method across both meters</li>\n<li>Set up reminders and auto-payments when you’re running low on credit</li>\n<li>Save money with the in-home display</li>\n<li>View tariff information</li>\n<li>See how long your credit will last</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>As well as the Boost Power app, your in-home display shows you your energy usage in real-time, monetary terms. You can see how much you’re spending at different times, how much each appliance costs, and where you can cut back to save money.</p>\n\n<p>Boost is encouraging the installation of smart prepayment meters across the country, working alongside the Government’s initiative to become carbon <b><a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/environment/net-zero/\">net-zero</a></b>. While most installations stopped at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, they’ve picked up the pace again and are being installed rapidly across the UK.</p>    \n    \n<p>To book your smart meter with Boost and make the most of your energy usage, click the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://smart.boostpower.co.uk/payg\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Request a smart meter</a></center>\n    \n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Problems topping up</h2>\n\n<p>As Boost specialise solely in prepayment meters, you don’t have to worry about getting bills through the post – you can top up whenever and wherever you like.</p>\n\n<p>With a traditional meter, you can top up your electricity card at any PayPoint or Payzone, however, your gas card can only be topped up at a PayPoint. They changed this recently to make it easier and quicker for customers to get a new card.</p>\n\n<p>If your credit hasn’t gone onto your meter, there are a few things it could be:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Your electricity key or gas card could be faulty</b> – Call Boost on 0330 102 7517 to sort this and get a replacement</li>\n<li><b>Your credit might have gone towards paying off a debt</b> – If you’ve used emergency credit, this will be taken off of your next top-up so make sure you put on enough credit to cover this as well as the energy you’re going to use</li>\n<li><b>There might be a problem with PayPoint or Payzone</b> – Take a picture of your receipt and send it to hello@boostpower.co.uk with the 20-digit reference number clearly showing</li></ul>\n\n<p>If it’s another reason, an error code should show up on your meter. Write down this code and call Boost on 0330 102 7517 and they can let you know what’s wrong and help fix it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key or card</h2>\n\n<p>With a traditional meter, it’s easy to lose your electricity key or gas card, or for something to go wrong. It happens to the best of us. Luckily, with Boost, it’s easy to get a new one.</p>\n\n<p>To get a new electricity key, simply call Boost on 0330 102 7517 and tell them you need a new key. They’ll give you an 8-digit ‘TAG’ code, which you can take to either a PayPoint or Payzone where they’ll give you a new key. Boost will be able to tell you which outlet you’ll be able to get your key from, however, it should be anywhere that issues EON and Npower keys.</p>\n\n<p>For a new gas card, you won’t be able to pick one up from a Payzone anymore, but a PayPoint should still be able to issue them. Simply call 0330 102 7517 to ask for a new card and you’ll be given an 8-digit ‘TAG’ code which you can take with you to pick up your new card.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re on a smart PAYG+ tariff, you won’t have to worry about ever losing your key or card again as you can easily top up through the app or your online account. You only have to top up once as your credit will be distributed to whichever meter needs it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"New-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re currently a Boost customer and are moving house, you’ll have to call Boost on 0330 102 7517 and let them know:</p>\n\n<ul><li>When you’re moving</li>\n<li>Where you’re moving to</li>\n<li>Your new phone number (if you have one)</li>\n<li>Who’s moving in and their contact details (if you know)</li>\n<li>Contact details of your landlord</li>\n<li>If you’re bringing Boost into your new home</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n    <p>It’s worth noting that if your new home doesn’t have a prepayment meter, you’ll have to get it changed so that you can stay with Boost. Some landlords might not allow this, so make sure you check before getting your new quote.</p>\n\n    <p>If you’re moving into a home supplied by Boost, whether you’re switching or not, you’ll have to contact them and set up an account. The switching process can take 21 days where you’ll still be with Boost and have to top up your meter until then. To set up your account, call 0330 102 7517.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n        <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n         </div>\n\n\n<p>If you’ve had a power cut, you can call your Distribution Network Operator on 105. While different regions of the UK have different Distribution Network Operators, 105 is the dedicated line for power cut and power line reports.</p>\n\n<p>If you suspect a gas leak, you should firstly open all the windows and doors and then switch off your supply. You can call the National Gas Emergency Helpline on 0800 111 999.</p>\n\n<p>If you think your gas leak might be carbon monoxide, you should try and get out of the house and call a doctor as soon as possible. Even if you’re not feeling unwell, you should still be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning. If anyone is feeling unwell, you should call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the Boost Power app</h2>\n\n<p>If you have a smart prepayment meter, you’ll want to download the Boost Power app to make the most of the benefits that come with your smart meter.</p>\n\n<p>Boost Power is a new, simplified version of the old app as many customers were complaining that it was confusing. However, there are still a few teething problems and it seems it may have been over-simplified, taking away a lot of features people found most useful.</p>\n\n<p>Download the Boost Power app on the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boost-power/id1266337181\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">App Store</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.boostpower.mobileapp&amp;hl=en%22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Play</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">I want to make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve had trouble with Boost and want to make a complaint, there are a few ways you can do this:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Fill out the form at the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.boostpower.co.uk/feedback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this page</a></li>\n<li>Email hello@boostpower.co.uk</li>\n<li>Call 0330 102 7517</li>\n<li>Write to or visit:<br>\nBoost Power<br>\n1 Rivergate<br>\nTemple Quay<br>\nBristol<br>\nBS1 6ED</li></ul>\n\n<p>Boost seems to be very quick and helpful when handling problems and complaints, however, if your complaint isn’t handled within 8 weeks or you receive a deadlock letter, you can contact the Energy Ombudsman by calling 0330 440 1624.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">I want to talk about the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>The Warm Home Discount is a Government-led scheme where eligible households can receive a £140 discount on their energy bills from September to March. As we all use more energy over the winter months, our energy bills are often a lot higher. The scheme was set up to help vulnerable and low-income customers afford these higher energy bills and, if you’re eligible, you’ll be placed in either the ‘core’ or ‘broader’ group.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n    <p>If you receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit, you’ll be in the core group. You’ll be entered into the scheme automatically and will receive a letter by the end of December. If you think you’re in the core group and haven’t had a letter, you should call the dedicated Warm Home Discount team on 0800 731 0214 before the end of February.</p>\n\n    <p>To qualify for the broader group, you’ll have to receive certain benefits and support. This criteria varies by the provider so you’ll have to check with Boost if you’re eligible. If you’re in the broader group and have any questions, you should call Boost on 0330 102 7517.</p>    \n    \n    <p>To find out more about the scheme and if you’re eligible, click the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../warm-home-discount/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">More about the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n  <h2 id=\"general\">There’s something else I need the Boost contact number for</h2>\n\n    <p>If there’s something else you want to talk about, there are a few other ways you can contact Boost to find the answer to your questions:</p>\n\n    <table>\n        <tbody><tr>\n            <th>Method</th>\n            <th>Number/link</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Call</td>\n            <td>0330 102 7517</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Email</td>\n            <td>hello@boostpower.co.uk</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Facebook</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/boostpoweruk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/boostpoweruk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/boost/warm-home-discount","category":"warm-home-discount"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/boost/contact","provider":"Boost"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
