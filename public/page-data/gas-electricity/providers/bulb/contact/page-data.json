Bulb customer service is above the industry standard, particularly for their complaints handling. To support this they also have a community forum to answer questions publicly as well as quick response times to customer queries. To this end it works as a building directory for resolution for many topics customers may encounter.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Give a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>The main way to submit a meter reading with Bulb and many modern energy suppliers is through their online resources. Logging onto your Bulb account or the mobile app should bring you to a simple process in order to log your meter reading.</p>\n\n<p>Bulb generally (but not totally) discourage dealing with queries over the phone, recommending their online portals be used instead unless it’s an emergency.</p>\n\n<p>Below you can see the available methods of contacting Bulb to give your meter readings, both online and over the phone:</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://account.bulb.co.uk/dashboard/meters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Via the app</td>\n        <td><a href=\"#app\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Bulb customer service</td>\n        <td>0300 30 30 635</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<h2 id=\"smart-meter\">Why is my Bulb smart meter not working?</h2>\n\n<p>Whenever tech is playing up, it can be extremely annoying but, when it’s your smart meter, it can also be worrying. However, there’s nothing to worry about if your Bulb smart meter stops working because it can be easily sorted.</p>\n\n<p>If your in-home display has stopped working, it could simply be that it’s run out of battery. This is the easiest fix as all you have to do is plug it back into the wall to charge it or change the batteries in the back of the display. It’s usually worth keeping it plugged in as much as you can as they have quite a short battery life.</p>\n\n<p>The older (SMETS1) and newer (SMETS2) generation of smart meters use different networks to communicate. Some providers aren’t connected to the same network as SMETS1 which means that these smart meters won’t be able to communicate with these providers. The two networks are in the process of merging at the moment, so this problem should be solved and obsolete soon, however, you might be able to upgrade to a SMETS2 if you contact Bulb.</p>\n\n<p>If neither of these are the problem, you should get in touch with Bulb by calling 0300 30 30 635 or through the live chat feature on their website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top up key/card</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve misplaced your gas card or electricity key it is easily remedied, Bulb will replace either one for free the first time either is lost. Any subsequent losses after the first will incur a £5 charge, placed directly on said key or card.</p>\n\n<p>In order to get a new electricity key or gas card, you’ll need to contact Bulb directly to get a replacement.</p>\n\n<p>Replacements usually take 3-5 working days to be sent out.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, with gas cards (unlike electricity keys) you are able to use the last 2 gas cards to top up; this may be a short term solution while you wait for your new Bulb gas card to arrive; provided you still have and can locate your old card(s).</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://help.bulb.co.uk/hc/en-us/requests/new\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Order a new key or card</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about my bill(s)</h2>\n\n<p>If you’d like to get in contact Bulb customer services regarding a recent bill or making changes to your account, this is the place for you. The quickest way to get a response from Bulb in regard to bill enquiries is their live chat. Initially processed by a bot, enquiries can smoothly transition to a human representative who can answer your questions.</p>\n\n<p>Bulb tries to reserve phone based customer service to emergencies and dealing with customers that will be better served in a call. For example, if you:</p>\n<ul><li>have an emergency, including if you’ve lost your gas or electricity supply</li>\n<li>are aged 60 or over</li>\n<li>have a disability or long term illness</li>\n<li>live with young children</li>\n<li>are concerned with paying for your energy</li></ul>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, if you do feel it necessary, call Bulb customer service on 0300 30 30 635, Monday – Friday, 9am – 5pm.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving house with Bulb</h2>\n\n<p>It’s not often someone exclaims “Wow, moving home was so smooth and uncomplicated”. In order to aid in the process, we have here some steps to make your utility migration to your new home easier with Bulb.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n    <p>If you’re with Bulb moving home, you need to make sure that you’ve done the following:</p>\n\n    <ul><li>Through your Bulb account, let them know that you are <a href=\"https://account.bulb.co.uk/dashboard/move-home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moving home</a>.</li>\n    <li>They’ll send you your final bill within a week from when you move out.</li>\n    <li>Do not cancel your Direct Debit during this time. If you are in credit they will refund you, if in debit they will be taking the last payment</li></ul>    \n    \n    <p>As you do move in, you’ll need to rejoin Bulb; an easy enough process:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Head to the <a href=\"https://www.bulb.co.uk/join\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sign-up page</a> and let them know your details</li>\n    <li>Give your first meter reading within 5 days of rejoining</li></ul>\n\n    <p>If you’re with Bulb moving house, you can call Bulb customer service on 0300 30 30 635 to get your opening/closing meter readings in place.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"switch\">I want to switch provider or tariff</h2>\n    <p>If you are considering changing your energy provider, Bulb doesn’t make this process troublesome on their end. This is because there are no exit fees and no contract attached to their tariff. Plus, signing up to Bulb is one of the quicker sign ups of any energy company in the industry.</p>\n\n    <p>During the switchover process, when switching to Bulb, they claim to refund any incurred exit fees up to £60 per fuel. Bear in mind that if you are within the last 49 days of your contract with your previous supplier you can leave without any charges.</p>    \n    \n    <p>Your first bill payment is taken when on the date you switch; 21 days after you signed up. This is then set as your payment date going forward if not adjusted from your account.</p>    \n    \n    <p>You are able to cancel your switch within 14 days of initiating it, though it is not possible to adjust your switch date. Again, this is because the 21 days to switch is static. The 21 days is inclusive of the 2 weeks you have to cancel.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If in credit with your old supplier, that balance is transferred to your bank account once you’ve received your final bill from them. If you are in debit on the other hand, you must settle your account sooner rather than later as the old supplier may stop your switch from completing.</p>    \n    \n    <p>For help switching providers, give Utility Switchboard a call on <b><a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">020 3992 7717</a></b>.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"power-cut\">I want to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n    <p>Power cuts and gas leaks should be sorted as soon as possible to ensure the safety of you and your family.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n        <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.
