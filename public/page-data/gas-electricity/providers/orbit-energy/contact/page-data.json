The reader will come from TMA and you’re entitled to ask to see their ID when they arrive to make sure they’re genuine.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key or card</h2>\n\n<p>Losing your top-up key or card is easy to do, but can be stressful. There’s no need to panic; it’s just as easy to get a replacement.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do to get a new electricity key or gas card is call Orbit Energy on 0333 103 8277 and ask for a new one. They’ll send your new key or card in the post or you might be able to pick one up from your local PayPoint.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that you might have to pay for each replacement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>With Orbit Energy, there are a number of different ways you can pay your energy bills:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Direct debit</li>\n<li>Credit card</li>\n<li>Prepayment (top-up key or card)</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you need to make extra payments, you can do so through your online account or by using the ‘Quick Pay’ service on their website. All you need is your account number (which you can find on your bill) and your card details.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://orbitenergy.co.uk/quick-pay\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a payment</a></center>\n\n<p>If you have a prepayment meter, you can top up by taking your electricity key or gas card to:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://consumer.paypoint.com/cashout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PayPoint</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://storelocator.payzone.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Payzone</a></li></ul>\n\n<p>If you have another bill query, you can use the live chat feature on Orbit Energy’s website or call 0333 103 8277.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re moving house, one thing you need to think carefully about is your energy provider.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>Whether you’re moving in or moving out with Orbit Energy, you’ll need to get in touch to let them know. When you contact Orbit Energy about moving house, you’ll have to let them know:</p>\n\n    <ul><li>Your contact details</li>\n    <li>Your account number</li>\n    <li>The new occupier (if you know)</li>\n    <li>Your moving date</li>\n    <li>Your new address</li>\n    <li>Your opening or closing meter readings</li></ul>\n\n    <center><a href=\"https://orbitenergy.co.uk/moving-home\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move house with Orbit Energy</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’re moving into a house already supplied by Orbit Energy and are planning on switching, you’ll still need to get in contact and get an account set up. This is because they’ll still be responsible for your energy supply until the final switch date and you’ll have to pay them for any energy used during the switching period.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to switch to Orbit Energy in your new home, you’ll have to request a new quote through their website or by giving Utility Switchboard a call on <a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\"><b>020 3992 7717</b></a>. While their variable tariff is always 5% below Ofgem’s price cap, if you opt for their fixed tariff, your new bill might be higher or lower than your current one. This is because prices can vary by location and you might be using a different amount of energy if your house is a different size.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n     </div>\n\n    <p>If you’re experiencing a power cut, you can call the dedicated power cut line on 105. This will put you through to your Distribution Network Operator (DNO) who will be responsible for restoring the power. When the power cut is reported, you can also use this line to receive updates, but you should keep an eye on it on your DNO’s website.</p>\n\n     <p>If there’s been a gas leak, you should call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. Open all the windows and doors to ensure good airflow and turn off any gas-powered appliances and supply before going outside for fresh air.</p>     \n     \n     <p>If you think it’s a carbon monoxide leak, you should also call a doctor to get checked for carbon monoxide poisoning – even if you’re feeling fine. If anyone is feeling unwell from it, you should call 999.</p>\n     \n<h2 id=\"smart-meter\">Get a smart meter</h2>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n    <p>Smart meters are being installed across the country in an effort to reduce our carbon emissions and bring the country to net zero.
