If it’s not plugged in, your IHD has roughly 4 hours worth of battery life, so it’s usually easier to keep it plugged in so you don’t encounter this problem.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an older smart meter (SMETS1) and you’ve recently switched to British Gas, it may be that your smart meter has reverted to ‘dumb mode’. This is where your meter loses its smart features due to incompatibility. You can request an update to a SMETS2 meter to fix the problem, however, these compatibility issues are due to be fixed in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>If neither of these are the problem, you should contact British Gas through their live chat service or by calling 0333 202 9816. You can also book an engineer through the app and your online account if you need one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top up key/card</h2>\n<p>If you have lost your gas card or electricity key, don’t fret, you’ll be able to pick up a new one from your nearest Payzone shop. Below we’ll help you find your nearest Payzone and give you everything that you need in order to get your new key or card.</p>\n\n<h3>Electricity key</h3>\n<p>In order to get a new electricity key, you’ll need to call British Gas to get a reference number upon referencing your meter serial number (MSN) which can be found on your meter. Follow the below steps and you’ll have your new key in no time:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Contact the British Gas customer service team</li>\n<li>Reference your meter serial number, which can be found below the barcode on your meter and will begin with either S or F. If you can’t find your MSN, then the team will help you out.</li>\n<li>They will give you a reference number that is to be given to your local Payzone</li>\n<li>Wait at least 30 minutes for your electricity key to be prepared</li>\n<li>Go to your local Payzone and collect your new key</li></ol>\n\n<p>You can get in touch with British Gas using any of the following methods to receive your reference code:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Call customer service – <a href=\"tel:+443332029802\">0333 202 9802</a></li>\n<li>Via WhatsApp – <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=447458029132&amp;text=Message%20a%20British%20Gas%20advisor%20with%20WhatsApp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a></li></ul>\n\n<h3>Gas card</h3>\n<p>Getting your new gas card should be free of charge, but depending on your local store they may charge you a small fee. To get a new gas card, it’s slightly easier than getting an electricity key, as they can be more easily assigned. There are some added steps, however, in the case that there’s an error with the meter.</p>\n\n<p>If there is an error with your card or meter, when contacting British Gas, make sure that you are nearby your meter so that you can make a note of any fault messages on the screen if there are any.</p>\n\n<p>In order to get your new gas card, follow the below steps:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Go to your local Payzone and request a new British Gas gas card</li>\n<li>Do not top the card up until you have activated your card, which means leaving it inserted into your meter for 1 minute</li>\n<li>Top up and use your new gas card as normal</li></ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about my bill(s)</h2>\n<p>If you’d like to call British Gas regarding a recent bill or making changes to your account, you’re in the right place.
