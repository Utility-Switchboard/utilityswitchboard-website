Here, we’ve got all the phone numbers, email addresses, and links to get your problem sorted.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Give a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>It’s important that you submit regular meter readings to make sure you’re billed correctly for your energy usage. If you forget, you’ll be sent an estimated bill, which will more often than not be for more than you’ve used.</p>\n\n<p>As So Energy offers online-only tariffs, the main way to submit your meter readings is online through your account. If you have both gas and electricity set up with So Energy, you’ll be able to submit both readings on the same screen. You can set up reminders every month to make sure they’re submitted in time too.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://account.so.energy/users/sign_in\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Submit meter readings</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"smart-meter\">Book a smart meter installation</h2>\n\n<p>Rather than submitting your meter readings manually, why not upgrade to a smart meter? Your smart meter can send your meter readings over to So Energy automatically so you don’t have to.</p>\n\n<p>But they’re not just for easily submitting meter readings, with a smart meter you can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>View your energy usage in real-time, monetary values</li>\n<li>Become more aware of your consumption habits</li>\n<li>Cut back on your energy usage</li>\n<li>Save money on your bills</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>So Energy is currently installing SMETS2 meters – SMETS1 meters should be back up and running as smart meters again shortly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Make a payment</h2>\n\n<p>Most So Energy customers prefer to pay by direct debit, one month in advance. This makes sure that you stay up-to-date with your payments and less likely to fall into debt.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not one for direct debits, you can also make payments:</p>\n\n<ul><li>By cheque</li>\n<li>Via bank transfer</li>\n<li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Over the phone</li>\n<li>By cash</li></ul>\n\n<p>To set up one of these payment methods, you can email help@so.energy or call 0330 111 5050.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">I’m moving house!</h2>\n\n<p>Moving house can be a stressful time – you have so much to do and so much on your mind. We’ve got all the info you need on how to move into or out of a home supplied by So Energy. Alternatively, you can give us a call and we can get everything set up for you.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<h3>I’m moving out</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re a So Energy customer already and want to bring them with you to your new home, you won’t be subject to any exit fees, but you will be put on a new 12-month tariff.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few things you’ll have to tell them before you move so that you can get set up in your new home or close your account if you want to leave them behind.</p>\n\n<ul><li>The last date you’re responsible for the property</li>\n<li>Who will be responsible for the property when you move (if you don’t know, you can include the details of the landlord or estate agent)</li>\n<li>Your closing meter readings</li>\n<li>Where you’re moving to</li>\n<li>Your move-in date</li>\n<li>Whether you want So Energy to supply your gas or electricity in your new home</li>\n<li>Information on your new home (how many bedrooms etc)</li>\n<li>Your opening meter readings (if So Energy will supply your new home)</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://soenergy.typeform.com/to/rPtlwK\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move house with So Energy</a></center>\n\n<h3>I’m moving in</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re moving into a property that’s supplied with So Energy, you should receive a letter from them when you move in letting you know. You’ll be automatically signed up for the ‘So Out of Contract’ tariff, but you can change this when you set up an online account.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://soenergy.typeform.com/to/rPtlwK\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move in with So Energy</a></center>\n\n<p>If you want to switch away from So Energy, all you have to do is get in contact with your new supplier and they’ll start the switch for you. Alternatively, you can give us a call at Utility Switchboard on <a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">020 3992 7717</a> and we can help you through the process.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll still need to let So Energy know that you’re leaving as they’ll supply your energy throughout the switching process and will send you a bill for any energy you use during that time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">I want to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you’ve had a power cut, you can call the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) on 105.</p>\n\n<p>If you suspect a gas leak, you can call the National Gas Emergency Helpline on 0800 111 999.</p>\n\n<p>If you think your leak might be carbon monoxide, call a doctor as soon as possible to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if you’re not feeling unwell. If you do start to feel unwell, get out of the house for some fresh air and call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>While So Energy is focused on its customer service and making sure their customers are happy, things can still go wrong sometimes. If you’d like to make a complaint, you can do so by:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Calling 0330 111 5050</li>\n<li>Emailing complaints@so.energy</li>\n<li>Filling out <a href=\"https://account.so.energy/unhappy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this form</a>.</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>So Energy is one of the many different energy providers offering the Warm Home Discount. Not everyone is eligible for the Warm Home Discount – it’s aimed to help vulnerable and low-income households – but those who are will receive a one-off payment of £140 to put towards their winter energy bills.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>If you’re eligible for the Warm Home Discount, you’ll be placed in one of two groups: the core group and the broader group.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group, you’ll be entered in the scheme automatically and will receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions with more information. You shouldn’t have to do anything else to receive the discount.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group, you’ll be receiving certain benefits and support. You’ll have to apply through your online account for the Warm Home Discount and you might have to provide evidence that you’re receiving the right benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Applications open in the Autumn and are reviewed in November. There are only a limited number of discounts available for the broader group so they’re given out on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://help.so.energy/support/solutions/articles/7000057243-warm-home-discount\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find out more about the So Energy Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s anything else you want to talk about, there are a few other ways you can contact So Energy.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Call</td>\n        <td>0330 111 5050</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td>help@so.energy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/soenergyuk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/soenergyuk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@soenergyuk</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/so-energy/contact","provider":"So Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
