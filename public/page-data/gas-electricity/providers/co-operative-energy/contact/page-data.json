While it may seem annoying, submitting regular readings ensures you’re being billed accurately and aren’t paying any more or any less than you need to be.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n    <p>With Co-operative Energy, there are a number of ways to submit your readings:</p>\n\n    <ul><li>Through your <a href=\"https://octopus.energy/login/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online account</a></li>\n    <li>Through your smart meter</li>\n    <li>Call 0808 164 1088</li>\n    <li>Email coop@octopus.energy</li>\n    <li>Through the <a href=\"#app\"><b>app</b></a></li></ul>\n\n    <p>If you’re prone to forgetting to give meter readings, there’s no need to worry; you’ll be sent monthly reminders to make sure they’re submitted regularly. Alternatively, you could <a href=\"https://octopus.energy/dashboard/smets2-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">request a smart meter</a> which will send readings at designated intervals automatically so you don’t have to remember.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key or card</h2>\n\n    <p>The one problem you don’t want to have if you’re on a prepayment meter is losing or damaging your top-up key/card and being unable to top up.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you do run into this problem, it’s really easy to get a replacement. All you have to do is contact Co-op Energy at prepayment@octopus.energy or call 0808 164 1088. You’ll have the option to have it delivered through the post or you might be able to pick it up from your local PayPoint.</p>    \n    \n    <p>It’s worth remembering that you might have to pay extra for each replacement.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n    <p>If you have a prepayment meter, you can top up at your local Post Office or PayPoint. Most Midcounties Co-Operative stores have a PayPoint machine and are able to top up, however, there are countless other stores to choose from.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://consumer.paypoint.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Find your nearest PayPoint</a></center>\n\n<p>If you have a standard, Economy 7, or smart meter, you can pay in a number of different ways:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Direct debit</li>\n<li>Cheque</li>\n<li>Bank transfer</li>\n<li>Credit/debit card</li>\n<li>Cash at a PayPoint</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can change your payment method through your online account or by calling 0808 164 1088.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re moving house, you’ll have to let both your current and new energy supplier know. If you’re with Co-op Energy, you can either call 0808 164 1088 or email coop@octopus.energy and let them know:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your new address</li>\n<li>Your moving date</li>\n<li>Your closing meter readings</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>If you’ve just moved into a house supplied by Co-op Energy, you should receive a welcome pack in the post when you move in. You’ll have to set up an account when you move in, even if you’re planning on switching providers, as you’ll still have to pay Co-op Energy for any energy you’ve used up until the switching date.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to switch to Co-operative Energy when you move or bring them with you to your new house, you’ll need to get a new quote. You can do this through their website or by calling 0808 164 1088.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>To report a power cut, you can call the dedicated power cut line 105. They’ll put you through to your distribution network operator (DNO) where you can report it or receive updates.</p>\n\n<p>If you suspect there’s been a gas leak, you should open all windows and doors, turn off your gas supply and call the National Gas Emergency Helpline on 0800 111 999. Try and get out of the house for some fresh air.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it might be a carbon monoxide leak, you should open all windows and doors and get out of the house. Call the National Gas Emergency Helpline on 0800 111 999 and then call a doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if you’re not feeling ill. If anyone does start to feel ill, <b>call 999</b>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the app</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re a Co-operative Energy customer, you can download the Octopus Energy app to take control of your energy usage wherever you are.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the app is only available on the Apple Store at the moment, but Android users can have their account pinned to their phone home screen and do most of the same things you can on the app. When you sign in through Chrome, you’ll receive an automated prompt asking if you’d like it added to your home screen.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/octopusenergy/id1093452209\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">I have a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something you’re not happy about, they will try and sort your problem as soon as they can or send you a plan of action on how they’re going to fix it and if there’s anything else you need from them.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing you should do is to contact Co-op Energy by calling 0808 164 1088 or email coop@octopus.energy. You’ll have to provide them with:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your contact details and account number</li>\n<li>Some background information on the issue</li>\n<li>How the issue is impacting you</li>\n<li>What you would like as a resolution</li></ul>\n\n<p>If it’s not resolved within 8 weeks, you can also escalate your complaint to the Energy Ombudsman either through their website or by calling 0330 440 1624. If they think that you’ve been treated unfairly or incorrectly, they will decide what needs to be done to put things right.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>The Warm Home Discount is a Government-led scheme which offers eligible customers a one-off payment of £140 to cover your energy bills from September to March.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>While Co-operative Energy is a small provider, they’re able to offer the Warm Home Discount through Octopus Energy. If you’re eligible for the discount, you’ll be placed in one of two groups:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>The core group</b> – To be eligible for the core group, you’ll be receiving the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit. You won’t have to do anything to apply and will be enrolled and paid automatically. You’ll receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions telling you about the scheme and if there’s anything else you need to do (there shouldn’t be).</li>\n<li><b>The broader group</b> – Eligibility for the broader group is more difficult. You have to receive certain benefits and support which can vary by provider. There are only a limited number of discounts for the broader group and are given out on a first-come, first-served basis. If you’re in this group, you’ll have to apply for the Warm Home Discount every year and aren’t guaranteed a spot.</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"/gas-electricity/providers/octopus-energy/warm-home-discount/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you want to talk to Co-Op Energy about, you can use the numbers and links below to get to the bottom of your problem.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Call (general enquiries)</td>\n        <td>0800 954 0693</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Call (account enquiries)</td>\n        <td>0808 164 1088</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Call (membership enquiries)</td>\n        <td>0800 435 902</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td>coop@octopus.energy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/cooperativeenergy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/coopenergy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@CoopEnergy</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/co-operative-energy/contact","provider":"Co-operative Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
