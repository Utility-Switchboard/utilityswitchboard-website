Our EDF Energy reviews from customers, other reviewers, and our own experiences with the company can help you decide whether or not EDF is the energy provider for you. As always, we’ve got you covered.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-customers-say\">What do customers say?</h2>\n\n<p>While we can help you decide which energy provider is for you, reading EDF Energy reviews can help you see what your future with EDF could be like. What do customers really think of EDF Energy?</p>\n<blockquote>I have been with EDF almost 2 years and never had issue. Customer service through what's app is very handy to get the queries answered. I also booked smart meter appointment which was very easy and straightforward. <b>-Danial, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n<blockquote>I found it easy to switch, however the top-up card and key required didn't arrive until after my switch date so I was unable to benefit from the switch for approx 3/4 days so that was disappointing. <b>- Mr G, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaints-handling\">EDF Energy complaints handling</h2>\n\n<p>If you ever do have a problem with your energy, you want your problems to be solved effectively and efficiently. We’ve looked into how EDF handled their complaints in Q1 2021.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Complaints handling</th>\n        <th></th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Number of complaints</td>\n        <td>81,721</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Complaints per 100,000 customers</td>\n        <td>1,717</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Number of complaints resolved</td>\n        <td>74,979</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Complaints resolved the same or next working day</td>\n        <td>56.62%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Complaints resolved within 8 weeks</td>\n        <td>91.74%</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>While this is an increase in complaints compared to Q4 2020, where EDF Energy received 75,856 complaints, they’ve improved a lot in the past few years. In 2014, EDF was receiving 250,000-300,000 complaints per quarter, but they have continuously improved since.</p>\n\n<p>The nature of their complaints are similar to those of their competitors:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Billing</li>\n<li>Meters</li>\n<li>Payments</li>\n<li>Customer service</li>\n<li>Switching suppliers</li></ul>\n\n<blockquote>They have totally betrayed my trust. Taken several sums of cash from my bank and ruined my 2 year fixed account. This is the worst experience I have ever had with any company ever. <b>- Megan Holmes, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"customer-service\">EDF customer service</h2>\n\n<p>According to customers, EDF Energy’s customer service can be hit and miss, depending on who you talk to, but most reviews show the customer service in a positive light.</p>\n\n<p>Customers are impressed with how quickly they’re able to contact the EDF customer service team, especially through the live chat feature on their website. Problems are often solved quickly and easily thanks to the friendly staff, even if you’ve had trouble with other members of the team.</p>\n\n<blockquote>The customer service rep always understands my questions and deals with them professionally and quickly. I always come off the chat a happy customer. If you are looking for great customer service EDF can definitely give you that. <b>- Deborah Giddings, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<p>EDF Energy has recently taken over Green Network Energy’s customers after the company went bust last year and its new customers are consistently praising the customer service staff for helping them through the switch. Many have said they’ve seen an improvement in EDF customer service compared to Green Network Energy’s.</p>\n\n<p>However, many customers complain in their EDF Energy reviews about being passed from person to person when they call or having to get in contact multiple times after their problem was unresolved or the outcome was different to what they were told.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Awful customer service. Took weeks to get an online account set up, duplicate account numbers, missed remittances, rude staff, cut off from several customer service phone calls. <b>- Chloe Victoria on Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<p>In March 2021, EDF Energy has been ordered by Ofgem to pay around 70,000 customers compensation after overcharging them when they switched supplier or tariff between 2013 and 2020. A total of £500,000 will be paid out, meaning affected customers will receive an average of £7.06 each. 17 other energy providers have been ordered to do the same thing as over 1 million customers were affected overall.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-in-touch\">Getting in touch</h2>\n\n<p>We tried out all the best ways to reach the EDF Energy customer service team at different times to help get an idea of how long you should expect to wait before speaking to a customer service advisor.</p>\n\n<p>Have a look at their average response times below.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Wait time</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td>17 hours 26 minutes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone</td>\n        <td>9 minutes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Live chat</td>\n        <td>Less than 1 minute</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Social media</td>\n        <td>2 hours 5 minutes</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><em>*Opening times only</em></p>\n\n<p>These wait times are quite impressive for a company of EDF Energy’s size and are a lot quicker than most of the Big Six energy companies.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../contact/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Contact EDF Energy</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"worth-it\">Is it worth the money?</h2>\n\n<p>EDF Energy isn’t known for having low prices for its energy tariffs. While more expensive tariffs often put people off a company, you often receive a better service paying a bit extra – you pay for what you get.</p>\n\n<p>Customers don’t seem to mind paying the higher prices, especially as EDF aren’t the most expensive energy provider either. You get the trustworthiness of a Big Six company as well as great customer service and a wide range of tariffs to suit everyone’s needs.</p>\n\n<p>EDF tariffs are 100% renewable and they also invest a lot of money in renewable energy and are the largest generators in the world. With two low-carbon nuclear power plants and a number of on and offshore wind farms under their belts, by choosing EDF, you’re helping improve the environment for the future.</p>\n\n<p>To make sure you’re not paying too much for your energy, call Utility Switchboard on <a class=\"inner-phone-span\" href=\"tel:+442039927717\"><b>020 3992 7717</b></a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">EDF app review</h2>\n\n<p>EDF Energy’s app is very extensive and a must-have for all EDF customers. Customers can use their online account details to log in and manage their energy on the go. Whether you’re looking to give meter readings or make payments, the app has a great rating for both its iOS and Android versions.</p>\n\n<p>Android users have given the app an overall rating of 4.2/5. While February 2021’s updates have seen users struggle with meter readings and slow connections, the general consensus is that this is an easy-to-use app with great features.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Not a bad app, but needs vast improvement to make it more reliable and customer friendly.<b> - JP Noonan, Google Play</b></blockquote>\n\n<p>iOS customers have given a slightly higher rating of 4.6/5. February 2021’s update has massively improved customer satisfaction. However, before the update, customers were seeing the same issues with submitting meter readings as Android users as well as common error messages not letting customers log in or use the app.</p>\n\n<blockquote>After the recent update, I find it very easy to navigate, do what I need to do and if I need to contact EDF I can do so via the App which opens up WhatsApp or SMS chats. Good work guys! <b>- Lord Barrold, The App Store</b></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"verdict\">Our verdict</h2>\n\n<p>EDF Energy stands out from the other Bix Six companies for its fair prices and high levels of customer service. One of its most appealing features is its dedication to improving our environmental impact as the largest generator of renewable electricity in the world.</p>\n\n<p>However, it can take some time for complaints to be handled, and reviews are mixed across the board. Their digital features aren’t quite up to scratch for a Big Six company, but it is definitely one of the better ones.</p>\n\n<p>Based on EDF Energy reviews from customers, other reviewers, and our own experience with EDF, Utility Switchboard is giving them <b>4/5</b>.</p>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/warm-home-discount","category":"warm-home-discount"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/contact","category":"contact"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/review","provider":"EDF Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
