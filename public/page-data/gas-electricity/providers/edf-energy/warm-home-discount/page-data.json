Offered by a lot of the big providers, the Warm Home Discount is a way to try and help end fuel poverty in the colder winter months. While not all providers offer the Warm Home Discount, EDF does.</b></p>\n\n    <p>To find out more about the EDF Warm Home Discount, how to apply, and check your eligibility, keep reading. As always, we’ve got you covered!</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is the Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n    <p>The Government’s Warm Home Discount scheme offers a discount on energy bills for low-income families, pensioners, and others who may struggle to pay their energy bills over the winter. We all use more energy over the winter months – we have the heating on more, we’re inside more, and it gets darker earlier.</p>\n    \n    <p>If you’re eligible, you can receive a one-off payment of £140 to go towards your electricity bill. It covers September – March and is paid straight into your electricity account or meter, or as a voucher if you have a prepayment meter by the end of March. EDF normally pay by the end of February.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"am-i-eligible\">Eligibility criteria</h2>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n    <p>There are two ways to qualify for the Warm Home Discount. They’re called the ‘core group’ and the ‘broader group’ (EDF call this the Support Plus Scheme). The core group automatically qualify for the scheme, however, the broader group have to apply for the Support Plus Scheme through EDF.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Core group eligibility</h3>\n\n    <p>If you receive the Guarantee Credit element of your Pension Credit, you’ll be in the core group. You’ll receive a letter in the Autumn letting you know you’re eligible for the scheme and will be signed up automatically. You don’t have to do anything to sign up.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Broader group (Support Plus Scheme) eligibility</h3>\n\n    <p>Different providers have different criteria you have to meet to be in this group. You can apply for the EDF Warm Home Discount:</p>\n     \n<ul><li>If you receive Income Support, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, or Income-based Job Seekers Allowance <b>and</b>:</li>\n    <ul><li>You’re responsible for a child under 5 who lives with you</li>\n    <li>You get a disabled child premium or Child Tax Credit</li>\n    <li>You get a disability, enhanced disability, or severe disability premium</li>\n    <li>You or another adult living with you get Attendance Allowance, Disabled Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payment</li>\n    <li>You get a pensioner, higher pensioner, or enhanced pensioner premium</li>\n    <li>You get a work-related activity or support group component of the Employment Support Allowance</li></ul>\n<li>You receive Universal Credit and your income was less than £1,349 in at least one month since October 2020 <b>and</b>:</li>\n    <ul><li>You get the limited capability for work element</li>\n    <li>You get the disabled child element</li>\n    <li>You get the Disabled Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, or Attendance Allowance</li>\n    <li>You get the child element benefit for a dependent child who lives with you</li>\n    <li>Your employment was terminated due to COVID-19</li></ul>\n<li>Your household income is less than £16,190 per year <b>and</b>:</li>    \n    <ul><li>You get Child Benefit for a child who lives with you</li>\n    <li>You or another adult living with you gets Disabled Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payments or Attendance Allowance</li>\n    <li>You or another adult living with you gets a disabled worker or severe disability element</li>\n    <li>You get a Carer’s Allowance</li>\n    <li>You’re over 62</li>\n    <li>You’re in work</li>\n    <li>You’ve served in the Armed Forces</li></ul>\n<li>You only receive the Savings Credit element of Pension Credit – not the Guarantee Credit element.</li></ul>\n    \n    <p>You may be asked for documents of proof before you’re accepted.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"which-group\">Which group are you in?</h2>\n    \n    <p>Choose which one applies to you and we can help you find out more about how to apply in your group.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standard-container\">\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#core-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt1\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-hands\"></i>\n                <h3>Core group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you automatically receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#broader-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt2\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-clipboard-list\"></i>\n                <h3>Broader group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you you'll need to apply to receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <h3 id=\"core-group\">Claim EDF Warm Home Discount in the core group</h3>\n    \n    <p>If you’re in the core group, you don’t have to do anything. You’ll be signed up automatically and your £140 will be in your account or meter by the end of February. You’ll receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions letting you know. However, if you think you’re in the core group, you can call 0800 731 0214.</p>\n    \n    <p>If you’ve received a letter, but no payment, look at the letter and find your reference number.</p>\n    \n    <p><b>If your reference number starts with ‘M’</b></p>\n    \n    <p>You shouldn’t need to do anything. Your discount will be sent to your account or your voucher will be sent in the post. If it’s not sent, you can call the Warm Home Discount helpline at 0800 731 0214. This number is only for those in the core group.</p>\n    \n    <p><b>If your reference number starts with ‘U’</b></p>\n    \n    <p>This means that the Department of Work and Pensions don’t have information on who your electricity supplier is. You’ll have to call the Warm Home Discount helpline on 0800 731 0214. or write a letter to the DWP at:</p>\n    \n    <p>Warm Home Discount<br>\n    Peel Park<br>\n    Brunel Way<br>\n    Blackpool<br>\n    FY4 5ES<br></p>\n    \n    <p>to give them your Meter Point Administration Number (MPAN) and your electricity account number. Both of these can be found on your bill.</p>\n    \n    <h3 id=\"broader-group\">Claim EDF Warm Home Discount in the broader group</h3>\n\n    <p>If you think you’re part of the broader group, you’ll have to apply through EDF directly by filling out their online form. Make sure you apply for the scheme as soon as possible as EDF only have a limited number of discounts available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>    \n    \n    <p>Applications are accepted in the Autumn but to make sure you don’t forget, you can set up an alert to remind you to apply when applications open. The application windows for different providers vary and can close early if they receive enough applications.</p>\n\n    <center><a href=\"https://my.edfenergy.com/warm-home-discount\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-i-switch\">What happens if I switch providers during the application window?</h2>\n<p>If you decide to switch suppliers from or to EDF after you’ve applied for the Warm Home Discount in the core group, you’ll still receive your discount from your new provider, whether they support the Warm Home Discount or not.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group, however, you’ll have to reapply with your new provider. But don’t forget, different providers have different eligibility criteria for the broader group so while you might be eligible at EDF, you might not at your new provider. You also won’t be able to receive your discount if your new provider doesn’t offer the scheme.</p>\n\n<p>How can I save money and keep my home warm if I’m not in either of these groups?\nUnfortunately, if you’re not in these groups, you won’t be eligible for the Warm Home Discount at EDF. However, there are other things you can do to keep your home warmer for less this winter.</p>\n\n<p>You can apply for the ECO Scheme. The Energy Company Obligation Scheme is another Government-led initiative which helps people lower their heating costs by becoming more energy efficient. With the scheme, you can benefit from free cavity wall insulation, free loft insulation, and a subsidised gas boiler replacement. To find out if you’re eligible for this scheme, you can call 0333 200 5119.</p>\n\n<p>EDF also has several different smart appliances available to make your home more energy-efficient, including smart thermostats, motion-controlled lighting, and smart plugs. By switching to smart appliances, you can save on energy costs all year round, not just in winter.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"worth-it\">Is the Warm Home Discount worth it?</h2>\n\n<p>Is a saving of £140 worth it? It seems like a crazy question, but where do these £140 discounts come from?</p>\n\n<p>While you may be saving £140 over the winter, you might be paying for this throughout the rest of the year. Around 11 million homes in the UK are on Standard Variable Tariffs, which is usually the most expensive they have to offer. A lot of customers aren’t even aware that they’re on the most expensive tariff because suppliers will put you on this tariff automatically when your fixed contract has expired. By simply switching tariffs or providers, you can save a lot more than £140, even without the Warm Home Discount.</p>\n\n<p>See an illustrated example below:</p>\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  google.charts.load('current', {packages:['corechart']});\n      google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawStuff);\n\n        function drawStuff() {\n          var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();\n          data.addColumn('string', 'Country');\n        data.addColumn('number', 'Supplier with no Warm Home Discount');\n          data.addColumn('number', 'With Warm Home Discount applied');\n          data.addColumn('number', 'Warm Home Discount');\n          \n          data.addRows([\n            ['SSE Fix & Control',0, 1063.81,140],\n            ['EON SVT',0, 978.16,140],\n            ['Scottish Power SVT',0, 978.14,140],\n            ['Simplicity 2020 Mushroom',954.13,0,0],\n            ['Green Kelvin', 873.83,0,0]\n          ]);\n\n         var options = {\n           title: 'Cost of tariffs with & without WHD',\n           isStacked: true,\n           width: '100%',\n           height: 500,\n           NumberFormat: { prefix: '£'},\n           legend: 'none',\n           bar: {groupWidth: '95%'},\n           colors: ['#EAD1DC','#31145B','#EAD1DC'],\n           vAxis: { \n               gridlines: { count: 4 },\n               format: '£###.00'\n           }\n         };\n\n         var chart = new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('number_format_chart'));\n         chart.draw(data, options)};</script>\n   <div id=\"number_format_chart\"></div>\n\n<p><em>Quotes made on 5/09/2021 for a London-based home using 3,100kWh of gas and 12,500kWh of electricity per year, paid for by direct debit.</em></p>\n\n<p>For help switching providers and saving money, give Utility Switchboard a call on <b><a href=\"tel:+442039927717\">020 3992 7717</a></b>.\n\n</p><h2 id=\"contact-the-team\">Contact the Warm Home Discount team</h2>\n<p>To talk to the dedicated Warm Home Discount team, you can phone or write to them at the details below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standard-container\">\n    <div class=\"col50 hidden-xs\" style=\"height: auto;\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1541.6681148871958!2d-2.996327973788887!3d53.79307578025086!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x487b43d0ce20118b%3A0x5beaa5e60d55dad7!2sDWP%20Peel%20Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1615543335348!5m2!1sen!2suk\" style=\"border:0;height: 100%;width:100%\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col50\">\n        <table>\n            <tbody><tr>\n                <td class=\"add-box-icon-box\">\n                    <i class=\"fas fa-phone-alt\"></i>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                    <p><strong>Telephone: <span style=\"color:#D338AE\">0800 731 0214</span></strong></p>\n                    <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><i>Freephone available Monday to Friday: 8:30am - 4:30pm (Closed bank holidays)</i></p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr style=\"background-color: #FFF;\">\n                <td class=\"add-box-icon-box\">\n                    <i class=\"fas fa-envelope-open-text\"></i>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                    <p><strong>By post</strong><br>\n                    Warm Home Discount<br>\n                    Peel Park<br>\n                    Brunel Way<br>\n                    Blackpool<br>\n                    FY4 5ES</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody></table>\n        <br>\n\n    </div>\n</div>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/review","category":"review"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/warm-home-discount","provider":"EDF Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
