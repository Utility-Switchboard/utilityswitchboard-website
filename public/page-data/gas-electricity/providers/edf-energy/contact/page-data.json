Because there’s more than one EDF contact number, we’ve made getting through to an EDF customer service advisor a little easier for you.</b></p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Give a meter reading</h2>\n<p>There are 4 different ways to give your meter reading to EDF:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through the EDF app</li>\n<li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Calling 0333 200 5108</li>\n<li>Have your smart meter send the reading automatically</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>You’ll have to give your meter readings regularly, but how regularly depends on your payment method. If you’re not sure what your payment method is, you can find out in your online account but EDF will ask for your meter readings when they need them.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t submit meter readings, you will be charged an estimated bill on how much energy EDF think you’ve used, which may end up being more than you actually have.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"smart-meter\">Why is my EDF smart meter not working?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, smart meter problems are all too common. If something’s gone wrong with your EDF smart meter, you’ll want it fixed as soon as possible. Most of the time it’s an easy fix, however, you might need to get an EDF Energy engineer out to help.</p>\n\n<p>If the problem is with your in-home display, the first thing you should do is check the batteries. The battery life of your in-home display is around 4 hours, so it’s worth keeping it plugged in to avoid future issues.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an older smart meter, it may be that your meter has lost its smart features. This can happen when you switch providers if your meter isn’t compatible with their software. Energy companies are working towards either upgrading meters or upgrading how smart meters work to bring the smart features back.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re still having issues, you can call EDF Energy on 0333 008 7000 or through their live chat on the website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key/card</h2>\n<p>If you’ve lost or damaged your electricity key or gas card, don’t worry – it’s easy enough to get a new one. Your first replacement key or card is free, but any replacements after that will cost you £7.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is fill out the form online. However, this can take up to 5 working days so, if you need one sooner, you can call EDF on 0333 200 5110 or use the EDF live chat service and they’ll try to get you one sooner.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n<p>Like most providers, EDF has all kinds of different tariffs to choose from, each with different payment methods to choose from. If you’re on a direct debit, you don’t have to worry so much about it as it’s taken out automatically. But how can you make payments otherwise?</p>\n\n<p>If you want to pay by debit or credit card, you can log in to MyAccount or call the EDF customer service number on 0333 200 5108.</p>\n\n<p>You can also pay through your online banking using the sort code <b>40-05-30</b> and account number <b>13845095</b> using your EDF Energy account number as the reference.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to pay by cash or card, you can go into either the Post Office or bank.</p>\n\n<p>To top up your prepayment meter, you can also visit a shop offering Payzone or PayPoint or pop into your local Post Office.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n<p>When you’re moving house, you have so many different things to worry about – don’t let your energy provider take up too much time. We’ve got everything you need to know about switching or moving providers into your new home.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re already an EDF customer, you can let EDF know you’re moving through your MyAccount. You’ll have to do this no more than 14 days before you move or in the first 30 days of being in your new home. All you need to do is give your account number, your new address, and your closing meter readings.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re moving to EDF in your new home, you’ll have to contact your old provider to cancel your contract, giving them your meter reading. Then, get in contact with EDF to sign up to your new tariff.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a new customer, call 0333 009 7155.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re already a customer, use your MyAccount or the EDF live chat.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n    <h2 id=\"power-cut\">Report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n        <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n         </div>\n\n<p>If you’ve had a power cut, you can call the Distribution Network Operators on 105. Different areas across the country will have different Distribution Network Operators, however, the number is always the same.</p>\n\n<p>If you suspect a gas leak, you can call the National Gas Emergency Helpline on 0800 111 999.</p>\n\n<p>If you think your leak might be carbon monoxide, call a doctor as soon as possible to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if you’re not feeling unwell. If you do start to feel unwell, get out of the house for some fresh air and call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the EDF app</h2>\n<p>With the EDF app, you can get reminders for appointments and upcoming meter readings. You can send the meter readings manually, or you can even take a photo of your meter and submit it that way.</p>\n\n<p>You can check, change, and manage your account 24/7 from your phone. Find out more about your tariffs and energy usage all in one place so you’re always in the know. When you’re in the know, you can see if there are any changes you can make to save money and energy.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.edfenergy.com/for-home/help-support/mobile-app\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download the app</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">I want to make a complaint</h2>\n<p>If for any reason, you might want to complain about something to EDF, there are a few different ways you can get in contact:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Call: 0333 200 5101</li>\n<li>Email: complaintresolution@edfenergy.com</li>\n<li>Text: 07481341928</li>\n<li>WhatsApp: 07480802942</li>\n<li>he EDF live chat.</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n<p>The Warm Home Discount is a government-led scheme which gives people £140 to put towards their energy bill over the winter. It’s designed to help low-income families and other vulnerable people afford to pay for the increased energy use and end fuel poverty.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>Not all providers offer the scheme, but EDF is one of the many who do. Each provider has different eligibility criteria and a limited number of discounts available so it’s important to apply early to make sure you’re accepted.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you might be eligible or want to find out more to apply, fill out the form below or call 0333 009 7010.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.edfenergy.com/warm-home-discount\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else…</h2>\n<p>For general questions, you can use the methods below to contact EDF Energy.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Customer service</td>\n        <td>0333 200 5100</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email</td>\n        <td>customer_correspondence@edfenergy.com</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Post</td>\n        <td>Freepost<br>\n            EDF Energy<br>\n            Plymouth<br></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/edfenergy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/edfcustomers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@EDFcustomers</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/login","category":"login"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/warm-home-discount","category":"warm-home-discount"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/review","category":"review"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/contact","provider":"EDF Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
