That means that more and more customer interactions will need to be done online.</p>\n\n<p>EDF has begun releasing tariffs that are <strong>online only</strong>, meaning that you cannot manage your account through the call centre. If you have signed up to one of these tariffs, <strong>the only way</strong> you’ll be able to do quite a few actions on your account will be through your online EDF login.</p>\n\n<p>If you have signed up to one of these tariffs, you will still be able to use the <strong>live chat</strong> function which does not require an online account; however, they may point you to your MyAccount area to perform some account actions.</p>\n\n<p>So, <strong>to summarise</strong>, you don’t <i>need</i> an online EDF login, but you might want to consider one if you want to get things done quickly and without any painful customer service interactions.</p>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/warm-home-discount","category":"warm-home-discount"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/review","category":"review"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/edf-energy/login","provider":"EDF Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
