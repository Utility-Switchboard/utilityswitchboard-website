This means that Robin Hood Energy customers looking to get in touch with their provider will need to contact British Gas instead. Here, we have all the different ways you can have your problems solved. As always, we’ve got you covered.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>There are more ways than ever to submit your meter readings now that your energy is supplied by British Gas.</p>\n\n<p>The most popular method of submitting meter readings is through your smart meter. With a smart meter, you won’t have to worry about submitting your readings every month as your meter will do it automatically!</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can submit your readings:</p>\n<ul><li>Through the app</li>\n<li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>By calling 0333 202 9816</li>\n<li>Via <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=447458029132&text=Message%20a%20British%20Gas%20advisor%20with%20WhatsApp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhatsApp</a></li></ul>\n\n<h2>My smart meter has stopped working</h2>\n\n<p>If your smart meter stops sending readings, your in-home-display (IHD) isn’t doing what it should, or there’s a horrible beeping noise, smart meter problems can be annoying.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a first-generation smart meter (SMETS1), you might also see problems when you switch. Older smart meters might be incompatible with your provider, meaning that they could lose their smart features, reverting to ‘dumb mode’. You can request an update to a second-generation smart meter (SMETS2), however, these compatibility issues are due to be sorted in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re having problems with your IHD, there are a few things that could be causing a problem. If you’ve recently switched providers, your IHD can take a few days to catch up. This is normal and should sort itself out by itself. It could also be that your IHD is placed too far away from your meter and it has lost connection. If this happens, you might hear a beeping noise. All you have to do to fix this is move your IHD closer to your meter (within 10m is best).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new key/card</h2>\n\n<p>Robin Hood Energy prepayment customers should have received their new British Gas top-up key/card around the time your supply was switched over (October 2020). If you haven’t received your new key or card, or simply need a replacement, it’s really easy to get a new one.</p>\n\n<p>If you need a new top up key or card, you should contact British Gas by calling 0333 202 9816. They’ll ask for your <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/meters/msn/\"><b>Meter Serial Number (MSN)</b></a> which you can find on your meter and give you a reference number. Wait 30 minutes and take this number to your local Payzone, where your new key/card will be issued.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that you’ll have to put your gas card into your meter to activate it before you can top up.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-quey\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n<p>If you need to talk about your bills, whether that’s old Robin Hood Energy bills or new British Gas bills, there are a few ways you can do so:</p>\n<ul><li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Through the app</li>\n<li>By calling 0333 202 9816</li>\n<li>Via <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=447458029132&text=Message%20a%20British%20Gas%20advisor%20with%20WhatsApp\">Whatsapp</a></li></ul> \n\n<p>Topping up with British Gas is a bit different from topping up with Robin Hood Energy. With British Gas, there are 3 main ways of topping up: at a Payzone/Post Office, through the app, or through your online account.</p>\n\n<center><a href='/gas-electricity/providers/british-gas/top-up/' class='curve-btn-main btn-white'>Find out more about topping up with British Gas</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you’ll no longer be able to switch to Robin Hood Energy in your new home. If your new home is still supplied by Robin Hood Energy, you’ll have to contact British Gas as they should have already taken over the supply. You can do this by calling 0333 202 9816.</p>\n\n<p>If your current home was supplied by Robin Hood Energy, you’ll have to let British Gas know you’re moving by calling 0333 202 9816.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>When you move, you’ll have to make sure that you:</p>\n<ul><li>Take a final meter reading in your old property</li>\n<li>Cancel your contract with your current provider</li>\n<li>Take an opening meter reading in your new home</li>\n<li>Give this meter reading to the current supplier in your new home</li>\n<li>Switch to a new tariff or provider and save!</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">Switch providers if you don’t like British Gas</h2>\n\n<p>You won’t have a say in who takes over your energy supply when <b><a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/switching/supplier-gone-bust/\">your provider goes bust</a></b>. However, you can easily switch providers to find one you like.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t want to be with British Gas, you can compare quotes online or call your preferred provider and let them do the switching for you. Alternatively, you can give Utility Switchboard a call on <a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">0203 992 7717</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As British Gas is your ‘deemed’ provider, Robin Hood Energy customers are able to switch without having to pay any exit fees. You might have to stick with British Gas for a few days, however, the switching process only takes 2-3 weeks and can be done by your new provider.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut</h2>\n\n<div class='inner-box-info question'>\n    <div class='inner-box-info-icon question'></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you’ve had a power cut, you’ll have to contact your DNO. You can find out how <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/distribution/whos-my-dno/\"><b>here</b></a> or you can call the dedicated power cut line on 105.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve had a gas leak, you should call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. If you’re feeling unwell after a suspected leak, call 999 and get some fresh air straight away.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the app</h2>\n\n<p>The British Gas app has tonnes of useful features when it comes to energy management, including:</p>\n<ul><li>Submit meter readings</li>\n<li>Book engineers and repairs</li>\n<li>Top up your smart prepayment meter</li>\n<li>View and pay your bills</li>\n<li>Set energy budgets</li>\n<li>Talk to customer service</li>\n<li>View your energy usage</li>\n<li>View and switch your tariff</li>\n<li>Claim rewards</li></ul>\n\n<div class=\"app-store-double\">\n    <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/british-gas/id1315960565\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/6tIOkBxFcLxfaYYwZG3ZRB/e1fc27b6d3e34a179640a88548bd5d2e/download-app-store.png\" alt=\"Download British Gas app on App Store\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bgmobilenga&hl=en_GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/7hmRcicCQzLoZWs5oJZ7Mx/d1ec589bffb6a56079ac155a701b0cc7/download-google-play.png\" alt=\"Download British Gas App on Google Play\"></a>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">The Robin Hood Energy Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>If you were due to receive the Robin Hood Energy Warm Home Discount, British Gas has agreed to still pay this on their behalf - you shouldn’t have to do anything.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta] \n\n<p>However, the British Gas Warm Home Discount eligibility criteria is much wider, so even if you weren’t eligible with Robin Hood Energy, you might be able to receive this year’s discount.</p>\n\n<p>British Gas offers the Warm Home Discount to two groups of people:</p>\n<ul><li><b>The core group</b>, who receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit</li>\n<li><b>The broader group</b>, who receive certain benefits and support</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href='/gas-electricity/providers/british-gas/warm-home-discount/' target=\"_blank\" class='curve-btn-main btn-white' rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Talk about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you wanted to talk about, you can use the following methods to contact your new provider, British Gas.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone</td> \n        <td>0333 202 9802</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Live chat</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.britishgas.co.uk/aem6/content/britishgas/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/britishgas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td> \n        <td><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/britishgas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/robin-hood-energy/contact","provider":"Robin Hood Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
