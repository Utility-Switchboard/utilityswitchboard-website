Luckily for you, we’ve broken down exactly where and how you can get most problems sorted easily. As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>Sending monthly meter readings makes sure that you receive an accurate bill for your energy. With your readings, Pure Planet can charge you for the exact amount of energy you’ve used, no more, no less.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll receive an email reminding you to submit your readings every month so you don’t forget, or you can let your smart meter do the work for you!</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>You can send your readings through the app either by taking a photo of your meter or by manually inputting the numbers. You can do this by going to ‘menu’ and then ‘send a meter reading’. If your meter is in a dark cupboard, the app has a handy torch feature you can use to see the meter without having to go off the screen.</p>\n\n<p>You can also give your meter readings through your online account in your browser, however, you’ll have to manually input these rather than taking a photo.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"payments\">Make a payment</h2>\n\n<p>Pure Planet tariffs are all paid by direct debit with the first one coming out on your switch date. You’ll receive updates throughout the switching process, so it shouldn’t come as too much of a shock and will be 17 days after you start the switch.</p>\n\n<p>After you’ve made your first payment, you can change the date of your direct debit to a day better suited for you. This is done under ‘balance and payments’ in your online account or through the app.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to make a one-off payment, you can do so through the ‘manage balance’ section of your online account. You’ll then be given the option to make a payment, set up a payment plan, or receive further support, depending on your balance. Once you’ve made your payment, you’ll be sent an email confirmation or what to do if your payment was unsuccessful.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can email collections@purepla.net if you don’t have an account but want to make a payment (for example, a landlord paying between tenants).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Move into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>When you’re moving house, you’ll have 101 things on your mind. Luckily, sorting out your new energy supply is quick and easy.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<p>If your new home is already supplied by Pure Planet, you should receive a welcome letter with instructions on how to get started. There should be a code in the letter which you can use to sign up for your Pure Planet account and get your energy supply sorted.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to do this even if you’re planning on switching providers as they’ll still be responsible for your energy supply until your final switch date. However, if you do decide to stay with Pure Planet when you move in, you can receive £25 worth of energy credit to your account.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://purepla.net/rfo/movein\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Move in with Pure Planet</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’re moving out of a home supplied by Pure Planet, you’ll have to let them know up to 2 days of your moving date. You can do this through your online account or through the app, letting them know your moving date, forwarding address, and final meter readings.</p>\n\n<p>Exit fees will still apply if you move house before the last 50 days of your contract, however, if you switch back to Pure Planet in your new home, these will be refunded. If you switch back within 3 months, you’ll also receive £25 worth of energy credited into your account. You’ll have to use the same email address for either of these to work.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">Switch to Pure Planet or change your tariff</h2>\n\n<p>To switch providers or tariffs, you’ll have to get a quote from Pure Planet. If you’re already a customer, you can do this through your online account or through the app. If not, you can use the methods below.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://purepla.net/get-a-quote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>App (Android)</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pureplanet.pureplanet&amp;hl=en_GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download the app</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>App (iOS)</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pure-planet/id1213875869?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download the app</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Compare all quotes</td>\n        <td><a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">020 3992 7717</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>To get your quote, all you need is your postcode and an idea of how much energy you use in kWh. This can be found on your bill or a rough usage based on Ofgem’s<a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/tariffs/average-usage/\"><b> averages</b></a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>If there’s been a power cut, you can call the dedicated power cut line on 105. This will put you through to your Distribution Network Operator (DNO) who is responsible for maintaining and restoring the power. You can also use this number to find out updates on the power cut, but your DNO will also have a power cut tracker on their website.</p>\n\n<p>If you think there’s been a gas leak, you should call the National Gas Helpline on 0800 111 999. Open all doors and windows to allow for better airflow and turn off any gas-powered appliances and supply before going outside for fresh air.</p>\n\n<p>If you suspect it might be a carbon monoxide leak, you should also call a doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if you’re not feeling unwell. If anyone does feel unwell at all, call 999.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">Downloading the Pure Planet app</h2>\n\n<p>You’ve probably noticed, there’s a lot of things that can be done through the Pure Planet app. As a 100% digital energy company, having an easy-to-use app with plenty of features is an absolute must.</p>\n\n<p>You can do pretty much anything through the app:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Submit meter readings</li>\n<li>Move house</li>\n<li>View your bills</li>\n<li>View and switch tariffs</li>\n<li>Get a quote</li>\n<li>Get help with WattBot</li>\n<li>Make payments</li>\n<li>Update details</li>\n<li>Compare your energy usage</li>\n<li>Refer friends</li></ul>\n\n<p>To use the app, you’ll need to be on a device which is Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and above or iOS 9 and above. You’ll also need access to your emails through the same device to receive your sign-in link, whether this is through an app or a browser.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pureplanet.pureplanet&amp;hl=en_GB\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for Android</a></center>\n<center><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pure-planet/id1213875869\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download for iOS</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">I have a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>When there’s something you’re not happy about, it can be infuriating not being able to talk to someone who can understand and rectify your issue. Because Pure Planet doesn’t have a call centre or a contact number you can call, the best way to make your complaint is through their online complaints form.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://purepla.net/complaints\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a complaint</a></center>\n\n<p>Once you’ve made a complaint, you’ll receive an email confirmation as proof it has been received. This email might also include other things to try to get your problem solved. When it’s been investigated, they’ll get in contact with information on what they’ve found and how they think it can be sorted. You can work together to find a solution.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>Pure Planet is one of the many energy companies which offers the Warm Home Discount – a one-off payment of £140 to help low-income and vulnerable households with their winter energy bills.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re eligible for the Government-led scheme, you’ll be categorised into one of two groups:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>The core group</b> – If you receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit, you’ll be a part of the core group. If you’re in this group, you should be sent a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions with more information on the scheme and you’ll be enrolled automatically. You shouldn’t have to do anything to get your Discount in March. If anything changes or you don’t receive a letter, you can call the Warm Home Discount helpline on 0800 731 0214.</li>\n<li><b>The broader group</b> – If you receive other qualifying benefits and support, you’ll be in the broader group. Which benefits qualify varies by provider so, just because you received the discount from one provider, doesn’t automatically mean you will with another. You’ll have to apply for the discount every year as there is only a limited number available, given out on a first-come, first-served basis.</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://purepla.net/warm-home-discount\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"general\">There’s something else I want to talk about</h2>\n\n<p>While Pure Planet doesn’t have a direct phone number, there are still multiple ways you can get in touch or have your questions answered.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>WattBot</td>\n        <td><a href=\"#app\">Download the app for access</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Online community</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://community.purepla.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joinpureplanet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@joinpureplanet</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/joinpureplanet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/pure-planet/contact","provider":"Pure Planet"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
