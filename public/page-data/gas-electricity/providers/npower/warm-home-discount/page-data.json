To find out more about your new provider, visit <b><a href=\"/gas-electricity/providers/eon/warm-home-discount/\">this page</a></b>.</p></span>\n   </div>\n\n    <p>Read on to find out more about the Npower Warm Home Discount, how to apply, and who can benefit from it.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is the Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n    <p>The Warm Home Discount was set up by the Government in 2011 to help low-income families, pensioners, and others who may struggle to pay their energy bills over the winter. We all use more energy in the winter as it’s getting dark earlier and we start putting the heating on more often. 62% of our energy usage over the year is used on heating alone.</p>\n     \n    <p>With the Npower Warm Home Discount, you can get a one-off discount on your electricity bill: £140 to cover September to March. Rather than being paid directly to you, this discount is paid into your account or sent as a voucher if you have a prepayment meter.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"am-i-eligible\">Eligibility criteria</h2>\n\n<p>Firstly, make sure your provider offers the Warm Home Discount. We’ve done some of the searches for you so, if you’re not with Npower, you probably won’t have to go far to find out.</p>\n\n<p>There are two ways to qualify for the Warm Home Discount Scheme:</p>\n\n<ul><li>If you get the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit</li>\n<li>If you receive certain benefits or support and meet your provider’s eligibility criteria</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Core Group eligibility</h3>\n\n<p>The 'core group' is for customers who get the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit.</p>\n\n<p>If you're in the core group, you'll be automatically entered into the Warm Home Discount scheme and will receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions letting you know.</p>\n\n<h3>Broader Group eligibility</h3>\n\n<p>There are a lot more eligibility options for the ‘Broader Group’, however, this group is on a first-come, first-served basis so you’re not guaranteed to be accepted into the scheme.</p>\n\n<p>Each provider has different eligibility criteria for this group, but to get placed in The Broader Group for the EON Warm Home Discount Scheme, you:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Are not recieving the Guarantee element of Pension Credit on 4th July 2021 <b>and either</b></li>\n    <ul><li>Born on or before 31 March 1956 and in receipt of Council Tax Reduction for low income</li>\n        <li>In receipt of the Savings Element of Pension Credit only</li></ul>\n<li>Receive Child Tax Credit with a total household annual income of £16,190 or less</li>\n<li>Receive Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>\n<li>Receive Income Support or Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, <b>with any of the following</b></li>\n<ul><li>A disability or pensioner premium</li>\n    <li>Disabled child premium</li>\n    <li>Child Tax Credit that includes a disability or severe disability element</li>\n    <li>A child under 5 living with you</li>\n    <li>Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payment</li>\n    <li>MATEX or MEDEX certificate</li></ul>\n<li>Receive Working Tax credit with a relevant income of £16,190 or less <b>with either of the following</b>:</li>\n<ul><li>Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment or a disability element</li>\n    <li>MATEX or MEDEX certificate</li></ul>\n<li>Universal Credit with monthly take-home pay of no more than £1,349 <b>with either of the following</b>:</li>\n<ul><li>Limited capability for work element OR Disability Living Allowance/Personal Independence Payment</li>\n    <li>A child element</li></ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may have to send documents with proof of this to be accepted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"which-group\">Which group are you in?</h2>\n\n<p>Choose which group you're in to find out how to apply for the EON Next Warm Home Discount</p>\n\n<div class=\"standard-container\">\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#core-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt1\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-hands\"></i>\n                <h3>Core group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you automatically receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n            <a href=\"#broader-group\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt2\">\n                <span>\n                <i class=\"fas fa-clipboard-list\"></i>\n                <h3>Broader group</h3>\n                </span>\n                This means that you you'll need to apply to receive the Warm Home Discount.\n            </a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-group\">Claim EON Next Warm Home Discount in the Core Group</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re in the Core Group, you will be written to in the Autumn and automatically enrolled in the scheme.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you’re part of the ‘Core Group’ and haven’t received a letter, you can get in contact with the Warm Home Discount helpline on 0800 731 0214.</p>\n\n<p>In the unfortunate event that you’ve received a letter, but haven’t received payment, have a look at your letter from the Department Work and Pensions for a reference number, and we might be able to help you out.</p>\n\n<p><b>If the reference number on your letter starts with an ‘M’:</b></p>\n\n<p>You shouldn’t have to do anything else. Your discount will be automatically transferred to your EON Next account or sent as a voucher to claim on a prepayment meter will be sent out to you. It should be with you by 31st March 2021.</p>\n\n<p><b>If the reference number starts with a ‘U’:</b></p>\n\n<p>The reason you haven’t received your payment yet is because the Department of Work and Pensions don’t have any information on who your supplier is.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is call the DWP or write them a letter to give them this information, which will start the application process. Let them know your Meter Point Administration Number and your electricity account number, which can both be found on your bill, by December at the latest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"broader-group\">Claim EON Next Warm Home Discount in the Broader Group</h3>\n\n<p>Applications for the ‘Broader Group’ are accepted and reviewed in the Autumn, however, it can vary by supplier and by year. It’s best to apply as soon as possible to make sure you’re accepted because the number of discounts EON can provide is limited.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s a Government-led scheme, you will have to apply through EON by filling out their online form or calling 0345 052 0000.</p>\n\n<p>Ex-Npower customers can use the link below to apply for the Warm Home Discount from EON Next.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.eonnext.com/warm-home-discount\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the EON Next Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-i-switch\">What happens if I switch during the Warm Home Discount window?</h2>\n\n<p>If you switch providers after you’ve applied for the Warm Home Discount, as long as you’re in the core group, you will still receive your payment. It will be transferred to your new provider, whether they offer the scheme or not, as long as you were an EON customer by the 5th July of the year you’re applying for.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group and switching to a provider which doesn’t offer the scheme, you won’t receive your payment. However, if you’re switching to one which does, you might still be able to get the discount, depending on your new provider’s eligibility criteria.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ineligible\">How can I save money and keep my home warm if I’m not in these groups?</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if you’re not in either of these groups, you won’t be able to receive the discount. However, there are other ways you can save money and stay warm with EON.</p>\n\n<p>You could apply for the Affordable Warmth Scheme; another government-led initiative. This scheme helps you to heat your home in a more energy-efficient and eco-friendly way. It allows you to spend less on your monthly bills – not just in winter. It includes a new boiler worth £395 or less, free cavity wall insulation, and a free loft insulation grant. To find out if you’re eligible for this, you just have to fill out their online form and you’ll receive a call from the ECO Home Team to send out a surveyor.</p>\n\n<p>Another Government-led initiative you could apply for is the Green Homes Grant. If you’re a homeowner or landlord, you can apply for a voucher for up to £5,000 to install energy-efficient improvements to your home. This could include insulating the walls and loft, installing low-carbon heating, or something else to make your house greener.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"worth-it\">Is the Warm Home Discount worth it?</h2>\n\n<p>What if there were other ways that you could save much more than £140 off your tariff?</p>\n\n<p>Around 11 million homes (~44% of the country) in the UK are on what’s called a ‘Standard Variable Tariff’ (SVT). This is the standard default tariff offered through a provider which has premium rates – usually the most expensive they have to offer. It’s often used when a customer’s fixed tariff expires or if you move into a new home.</p>\n\n<p>Most SVT customers are with the Big Six energy suppliers, EON being one of them. These are the kinds of companies that offer the Warm Home Discount as they have enough premium-rate customers to afford giving away £140. However, even if you switched to providers that might not provide the Warm Home Discount, you could save much more than £140.</p>\n\n<p>See below an illustrated example*</p>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  google.charts.load('current', {packages:['corechart']});\n      google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawStuff);\n\n        function drawStuff() {\n          var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();\n          data.addColumn('string', 'Country');\n        data.addColumn('number', 'Supplier with no Warm Home Discount');\n          data.addColumn('number', 'With Warm Home Discount applied');\n          data.addColumn('number', 'Warm Home Discount');\n          \n          data.addRows([\n            ['SSE Fix & Control',0, 1063.81,140],\n            ['EON SVT',0, 978.16,140],\n            ['Scottish Power SVT',0, 978.14,140],\n            ['Simplicity 2020 Mushroom',954.13,0,0],\n            ['Green Kelvin', 873.83,0,0]\n          ]);\n\n         var options = {\n           title: 'Cost of tariffs with & without WHD',\n           isStacked: true,\n           width: '100%',\n           height: 500,\n           NumberFormat: { prefix: '£'},\n           legend: 'none',\n           bar: {groupWidth: '95%'},\n           colors: ['#EAD1DC','#31145B','#EAD1DC'],\n           vAxis: { \n               gridlines: { count: 4 },\n               format: '£###.00'\n           }\n         };\n\n         var chart = new google.visualization.ColumnChart(document.getElementById('number_format_chart'));\n         chart.draw(data, options)};</script>\n   <div id=\"number_format_chart\"></div>\n\n<p><em>Quotes made on 5/09/2021 for a London-based home using 3,100kWh of gas and 12,500kWh of electricity per year, paid for by direct debit.</em></p>\n\n<p>For help switching and saving money, contact Utility Switchboard on <a href=\"tel:+442039927717\"><b>020 3992 7717</b></a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-the-team\">Contact the Warm Home Discount team</h2>\n\n<p>To talk to the dedicated Warm Home Discount team, you can phone or write to them at the details below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"standard-container\">\n    <div class=\"col50 hidden-xs\" style=\"height: auto;\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1541.6681148871958!2d-2.996327973788887!3d53.79307578025086!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x487b43d0ce20118b%3A0x5beaa5e60d55dad7!2sDWP%20Peel%20Park!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1615543335348!5m2!1sen!2suk\" style=\"border:0;height: 100%;width:100%\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col50\">\n        <table>\n            <tbody><tr>\n                <td class=\"add-box-icon-box\">\n                    <i class=\"fas fa-phone-alt\"></i>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                    <p><strong>Telephone: <span style=\"color:#D338AE\">0800 731 0214</span></strong></p>\n                    <p style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><i>Freephone available Monday to Friday: 8:30am - 4:30pm (Closed bank holidays)</i></p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr style=\"background-color: #FFF;\">\n                <td class=\"add-box-icon-box\">\n                    <i class=\"fas fa-envelope-open-text\"></i>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                    <p><strong>By post</strong><br>\n                    Warm Home Discount<br>\n                    Peel Park<br>\n                    Brunel Way<br>\n                    Blackpool<br>\n                    FY4 5ES</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody></table>\n        <br>\n\n    </div>\n</div>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/npower/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/npower/review","category":"review"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/npower/warm-home-discount","provider":"Npower"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
