Logging onto your online account should bring you to a simple process in order to log your meter reading.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d rather speak to a human to submit your meter reading, this is also an option – via calling customer service directly and handling it over the phone.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n    <p>Below you can see the available methods of contacting Npower to give your meter readings, both online and over the phone:</p>\n\n    <table>\n        <tbody><tr>\n            <th>Method</th>\n            <th>Number/link</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Customer Service</td>\n            <td>0345 052 0000</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Online</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://www.eonenergy.com/for-your-home/your-account/meter-readings-non-css\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Live chat</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://www.eonenergy.com/help/metering/reading-your-meter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody></table>\n\n    <h2 id=\"smart-meter\">My Npower smart meter isn’t working</h2>\n\n    <p>If your smart meter has stopped working, it’s usually fairly easy to get it fixed, depending on the issue.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If there’s a problem with your in-home display (IHD), the first thing to check is the battery. In-home displays don’t have a very long battery life, so you should try and keep it plugged in and charging whenever you can. You can also try turning the IHD off and on again to see if that solves the problem.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If your smart meter isn’t sending readings or lost its other smart features when you switched provider, it may be that you have an older generation smart meter that isn’t compatible with your new provider’s technology. A fix for this is in the works, however, you might be able to persuade them to upgrade your meter to a newer one.</p>   \n    \n    <p>The best way to make sure your smart meter gets back up and running is to get in touch either through the live chat feature or by calling 0345 052 0000.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top up key/card</h2>\n\n    <p>If you have lost your gas card or electricity key, don’t fret, you’ll be able to pick up a new one from your nearest Payzone shop. Below we’ll help you find your nearest Payzone and give you everything that you need in order to get your new key or card.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Get a new electric key</h3>\n    \n    <p>In order to get a new electricity key, you’ll need to call EON to get a reference number. Follow the below steps and you’ll have your new key in no time:</p>    \n    \n    <ol><li>Call the EON customer service team on 0345 301 5955</li>\n    <li>Reference your <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/meters/msn/\"><b>meter serial number (MSN)</b></a>, which can be found below the barcode on your meter and will begin with either S or F. If you can’t find your MSN, then the team will help you out.</li>\n    <li>They will give you a reference number that is to be given to your local Payzone</li>\n    <li>Wait at least 30 minutes for your electricity key to be prepared</li>\n    <li>Go to your local Payzone and collect your new key</li></ol>\n\n    <p>Alternatively, you can fill out <a href=\"https://www.eonenergy.com/for-your-home/your-account/prepayment/lost-card-or-key\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this form</a>. However, it will take slightly longer to get your key to you.</p>\n\n\n    <h3>Get a new gas card</h3>\n\n    <p>Getting your new gas card should be free of charge, but depending on your local store they may charge you a small fee. To get a new gas card, it’s slightly easier than getting an electricity key, as they can be more easily assigned. There are some added steps, however, in the case that there’s an error with the meter.</p>\n    \n    <p>If there is an error with your card or meter, when contacting customer service, make sure that you are nearby your meter so that you can make a note of any fault messages on the screen if there are any.</p>\n    \n    <p>In order to get your new gas card, follow the below steps:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Go to your local Payzone and request a new EON gas card.</li>\n    <li>Do not top the card up until you have activated your card, which means leaving it inserted into your meter for 1 minute.</li>\n    <li>Top up and use your new gas card as normal.</li></ul>\n\n    <h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about my bill(s)</h2>\n\n    <p>If you’d like to contact EON regarding a recent bill or making changes to your account, you’re in the right place.

In order to lighten the load in regards to dealing with transferring utility accounts and billing we have a little primer for moving home with Npower or EON.</p>\n\n<p>When you move into a new home, you need to make sure that you’ve done the following:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Take a final meter reading in your old property</li>\nCall the provider from your old property to cancel your contract, giving them your final meter reading, too\n<li>Take an opening meter reading in your new property</li>\n<li>Give the opening meter reading to the existing supplier in the property</li>\n<li>Sign up to a new tariff in your new home</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you’re moving in or moving out, you can call 0345 303 3020.\n\n    </p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n    <h2 id=\"switch\">I want to switch provider or tariff</h2>\n       \n    <p>Unfortunately, you can no longer switch to Npower, however, you can easily switch to or from EON.</p>\n\n    <p>If you were an Npower customer, you can switch away from EON without having to pay any exit fees if you'd rather not be with EON or would like to switch to a different tariff.</p>\n\n    <p>If you want to switch to EON, you can <a href=\"https://www.eonnext.com/electricity-and-gas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get a quote online</a> or call 0808 501 5200.</p>\n\n    <p>Alternatively, you can call Utility Switchboard on <b><a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">020 3992 7717</a></b> to find the best tariff for you.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"power-cut\">I need to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n        <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.
