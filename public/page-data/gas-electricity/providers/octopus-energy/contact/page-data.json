Lucky for you, there are loads of easy ways to contact Octopus Energy, no matter your query. We’ve found all of the right people to talk to so you can sit back and relax. As always, we’ve got you covered!</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Submit a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>Submitting meter readings to your energy provider can seem like a boring task, but it’s a very important one if you don’t want to be paying for energy you’re not using or end up with surprise debts.</p>\n\n<p>Octopus Energy will email you when it’s time for you to submit your meter readings around the 25th of every month, and you’ll have until the 1st to for it to be used in your monthly invoice. If you don’t submit one in that window, you’ll be given an estimated bill, which is normally higher than your actual use.</p>\n\n<p>You can submit your readings:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through your online account</li>\n<li>Automatically with a smart meter</li>\n<li>Call 0808 164 1088</li>\n<li>Email hello@octopus.energy</li>\n<li>Have a meter reader come out</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you don’t give a reading for several months or struggle to read your meter, Octopus Energy will send out a meter reader to take one for you. The reader will be from either TMA or Lowri Beck and you’re completely entitled to ask for ID when they arrive.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"smart-meter\">My Octopus Energy smart meter isn’t working</h2>\n\n    <p>If something’s gone wrong with your Octopus Energy smart meter, you’ll want it back up and running as soon as you can. Most of the time, it’s an easy fix, however, you might have to wait a bit longer for a more complicated problem.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you have an older smart meter (SMETS1), it might lose some of its smart features if Octopus can’t communicate with your meter. The only SMETS1 meters Octopus Energy can connect to are those made by SECURE™, so any others will revert to ‘dumb mode’, however, updates to SMETS1 meters are in the works to allow them to work when you switch providers. Octopus will contact you when your meter will become smart again.</p>    \n    \n    <p>The best way to get your smart meter back up and running is is to contact Octopus Energy by calling 0808 164 1088 or emailing hello@octopus.energy</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Get a new top-up key or card</h2>\n\n    <p>It’s easy to lose your key or card, but you’ll want a replacement as soon as possible.</p>    \n    \n    <p>Unfortunately, Octopus Energy doesn’t support smart prepayment meters just yet, so you’ll have to either wait for your new one to arrive in the post, or you might be able to pick one up from your local PayPoint.</p>    \n    \n    <p>To get a new key or card, email prepayment@octopus.energy or call 0808 164 1088. You might have to pay extra for a replacement.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"bill-query\">Paying bills and topping up</h2>\n\n    <p>Keeping your meter topped up and your bills paid for is extremely important if you want your energy supply to stay on. Even if you go on holiday, you’ll still want some appliances, such as your fridge, kept on.</p>    \n    \n    <p>You might have to pay Octopus Energy a small amount when you first join to cover the first month so that you don’t fall into debt if they’ve underestimated your energy usage.</p>    \n    \n    <p>It’s preferred that you make your payments by direct debit, however, you can also pay by:</p>\n\n    <ul><li>Bank transfer</li>\n    <li>Cheque</li>\n    <li>Credit/debit card</li>\n    <li>PayPoint</li></ul>\n\n    <p>You can change this on your online account or by calling 0808 164 1088.</p>\n    \n    <h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n    <p>If you’re moving out with Octopus Energy, you can let them know you’re moving through your online account or by emailing hello@octopus.energy even if you don’t want to take them with you to your new home. This allows them to close your account or start the switching process early.</p>    \n    \n    <p>So that Octopus Energy is supplying your electricity in your new home as soon as you move in, you should do this at least 17 days before you move in, however, you can do it later or even after you’ve moved in if you like.</p>    \n    \n    <p>If you’re moving into a home supplied by Octopus Energy already, you should receive a ‘move-in’ card in the post. This tells you how to set up your new account if you want to stay with Octopus Energy, or you can switch to a different provider if you wish.</p>   \n    \n    <p>If you don’t receive the ‘move-in’ card and want to set up your account, email hello@octopus.energy with your:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Name</li>\n    <li>Email address</li>\n    <li>Phone number</li>\n    <li>Move-in date</li>\n    <li>Opening meter readings</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage. Your distribution network operator is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the electric and gas networks up and down the country.</p></span>\n     </div>\n\n<p>If you’ve had a power cut, you can call the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) on 105.</p>\n\n<p>If you suspect a gas leak, you can call the National Gas Emergency Helpline on 0800 111 999.</p>    \n    \n<p>If you think your leak might be carbon monoxide, call a doctor as soon as possible to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, even if you’re not feeling unwell. If you do start to feel unwell, get out of the house for some fresh air and <b>call 999</b>.</p>\n    \n<h2 id=\"app\">How to download the Octopus Energy app</h2>\n\n<p>The Octopus Energy app is only available for iOS at the moment but it’s set to be released on Android very soon.</p>    \n    \n<p>You can do all the same things in the app that you can in your online account, it’s just easier to access while you’re out and about.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/octopusenergy/id1093452209\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Download the Octopus Energy app</a></center>\n\n<p>Android users won’t miss out on much though – you can still have your Octopus Energy account on your phone’s home screen. When you sign in through Chrome on Android, you’ll receive an automated prompt asking if you want to add your dashboard to your home screen. It works almost the same as the app but doesn’t take up as much space or have as much access to your phone’s hardware.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">I have a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>While almost all Octopus Energy customers are happy with their service, you might have something you want to complain about.</p>\n\n<p>To make your complaint, you can either email issueresolution@octopus.energy or write to:</p>\n\n<p>Octopus Energy Ltd<br>\n2nd Floor<br>\nUK House<br>\n164-182 Oxford Street<br>\nLondon<br>\nW1D 1NN</p>\n\n<p>Most of their complaints are resolved within 1 working day, and over 90% are resolved within 8 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>After you’ve made your complaint, Octopus lets you take it to their CEO at greg@octopus.energy and let him know your account number, contact details, and how your problem has been handled so far. He might be able to access better resources to help you out.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"warm-home-discount\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>The Warm Home Discount aims to help low-income and vulnerable households afford their energy bills over the winter months. We all use more energy as it gets colder and darker where we have the heating and lights on more often. With the Warm Home Discount, some households can receive a £140 discount to cover these increasing costs.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta] \n\n    <p>If you’re eligible for the Warm Home Discount, you’ll be categorised into one of two groups: the core group or the broader group.</p>\n\n    <p>The core group receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit. They’ll be accepted for the discount automatically and will receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions letting them know.</p>    \n    \n    <p>To be accepted into the broader group, you will be claiming certain benefits and meet other criteria. This criteria varies by provider and unlike the core group, you’ll have to apply every year.</p>    \n    \n    <p>To find out more, you can call the Warm Home Discount team on 0800 731 0214 or click the button below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../warm-home-discount/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Find out more about Octopus Energy's Warm Home Discount</a></center>   \n\n<h2 id=\"general\">Contact Octopus Energy about something else</h2>\n\n<p>If there’s something else you want to talk about, you can contact Octopus Energy by emailing hello@octopus.energy or calling 0808 164 1088.</p>\n\n<p>For business enquiries, you should email business@octopus.energy or call 020 3389 5613.</p>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/octopus-energy/smart-tariffs","category":"smart-tariffs"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/octopus-energy/warm-home-discount","category":"warm-home-discount"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/octopus-energy/contact","provider":"Octopus Energy"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
