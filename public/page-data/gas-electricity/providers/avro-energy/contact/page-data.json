As long as you submit your meter readings monthly, you’ll always be sent an accurate bill.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t submit your meter readings, you’ll be sent an estimated bill of how much gas and electricity Avro Energy thinks you’ve used, which is often higher than your actual usage.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few ways you can submit your readings, but the easiest way is through your smart meter. As long as it’s in smart mode, it will send your readings over automatically at regular intervals set by you.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>The preferred way of submitting readings manually is through your online account, however, you can also do this by calling 0330 058 2005 or emailing support@avroenergy.co.uk and giving them:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your account number</li>\n<li>The name of the account holder</li>\n<li>Your address</li>\n<li>Your readings (clearly specify which is for gas and which is for electricity)</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Talk about your bills</h2>\n\n<p>You can view your bills through your online account, but if you have any questions about them, the quickest way to get answers would be by calling 0330 058 2005 or using Avro Energy’s live chat. You can also email support@avroenergy.co.uk however, customers have said getting a reply can take a few days.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you want to make changes to your account or billing, you can do this through your online account. You can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Make additional payments</li>\n<li>Change your direct debit amount</li>\n<li>Change your payment date</li>\n<li>Change your bank and account details</li>\n<li>Change your tariff</li></ul>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.avroenergy.co.uk/sign-in\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign in to your account</a></center>\n\n<h3>Making payments</h3>\n\n<p>If you’ve run into a bit of a debt or your payments won’t cover this month’s energy use, you can make additional, one-off payments to top up your account.</p>\n\n<p>All you need to do this is your account number (which you can find on your bill or online account) and your card details.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://my.avroenergy.co.uk/guest/one-off-payment\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Make a payment</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">I’m moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>Moving house can be an exciting, but stressful time. Luckily, there’s not a lot you need to do when you move with Avro Energy.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you’re bringing Avro Energy with you to your new home or not, you’ll need to email cot@avroenergy.co.uk and give them your:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Closing meter readings</li>\n<li>Account number</li>\n<li>Contact details</li>\n<li>Current address</li>\n<li>New address</li>\n<li>Moving date</li>\n<li>Landlord or letting agent (if rented)</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n<h3>I want to bring Avro Energy with me</h3>\n\n<p>Bringing Avro Energy with you to your new home is simple. All you have to do is let them know when you send them your new details and they can arrange the switch for you.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can switch online through your online account.</p>\n\n<p>If your new home has a prepayment meter, you’ll have to contact the energy company currently supplying your new home so they can change your meter type as Avro Energy doesn’t support prepayment meters or even change them for you.</p>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that your new tariff might cost more or less than your current one, depending on the area and property type you’re moving to.</p>\n\n<h3>My new home is supplied by Avro Energy</h3>\n\n<p>If you’ve moved into a home supplied by Avro Energy, you’ll have to set up a new account so that they can charge you for any energy you use from your move-in date.</p>\n\n<p>You should email cot@avroenergy.co.uk with your:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Name</li>\n<li>Contact details</li>\n<li>Opening meter readings</li>\n<li>Payment details</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you want to stay with Avro Energy, you don’t have to do anything else. If you’d like to switch to a different provider, you simply have to contact your chosen provider and they’ll do the rest.</p>\n\n<p>For help switching energy providers, give Utility Switchboard a call on <a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"inner-phone-span\">020 3992 7717</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">How to report a power cut or gas leak</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.

Open all windows and doors, turn off any gas-powered appliances, and get out of the house.</p>\n\n<p>If you think it might be carbon monoxide, you should also call a doctor to get tested for carbon monoxide poisoning. Even if you’re not feeling unwell, it could still have affected you. If you are feeling unwell, <b>call 999</b>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaint\">I have a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If something has gone wrong or you want to complain, there are a number of ways you can do so:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Email support@avroenergy.co.uk</li>\n<li>Call 0330 058 2005</li>\n<li>Write to:<br>\nAvro Energy<br>\nWheatfield House<br>\nWheatfield Way<br>\nHinckley<br>\nLeicestershire<br>\nLE10 1YG</li></ul>\n\n<p>Over 90% of their complaints are resolved by the end of the next working day and 99% are resolved within 8 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not happy with the way your complaint has been handled, you can contact Citizen’s Advice at any point by calling 0345 404 0506.

Eligible customers can receive a £140 discount on their electricity bill to cover September to March when we’re using more and spending more on energy.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>If you’re eligible, you’ll be placed in one of two groups, both of which apply for the discount in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>If you receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit, you’ll be placed in the <b>‘core’ group</b>. You won’t have to apply for the Warm Home Discount as you’ll be automatically enrolled every year. You’ll receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) letting you know when you’ll be sent the discount and if there’s anything else you have to do (there shouldn’t be).</p>\n\n<p>The other group is called the <b>‘broader group’</b>. To be in this group you’ll have to receive certain benefits and support. If you’re in the broader group, you’ll have to apply for the discount every year, however, the criteria can change by year and provider so you won’t automatically be eligible.
