Chances are, once you’re a customer, you’ll receive the same treatment and possibly even come across the same issues.</b></p>\n\n<p>Using EON reviews from customers, energy experts, and our own experiences, we can help decide if EON is the provider for you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customers\">What do customers say?</h2>\n\n<p>Existing customers are the best people to listen to when it comes to reviews. These reviews will help you see what to expect as an EON customer and what to look out for.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Very impressed at every stage, whoever we spoke to was very informative. The contractors were prompt, polite, informative and very tidy. Overall a very impressive performance. <b>-Rob, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>EON promise everything but in reality same as every other supplier. <b>-Russell Llewellyn, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"complaints\">EON complaints handling</h2>\n\n<p>No one wants to have a bad experience with their energy provider, but it’s still important to know how any complaints you have might be handled. The last EON complaints report was published in Q3 of 2020 and you can find the most important findings below.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th colspan=\"2\">Complaints handling</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Number of complaints</td>\n        <td> 90,456</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Complaints per 100,000 customers</td> \n        <td>1587</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Number of complaints resolved</td>\n        <td>77,004</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Complaints resolved the same or next working day</td>\n        <td>58%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Complaints resolved within 8 weeks</td>\n        <td>91%</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>This is a massive improvement on Q2, which saw over 180,000 complaints (3,079 per 100,000 customers). However, despite receiving fewer complaints, it has taken them longer in Q3 to fix the issues, with 76% of Q2 EON complaints being resolved the same or next working day.</p>\n\n<p>The top reasons for EON complaints are:</p>\n<ul><li>Customer service</li>\n<li>Bills</li>\n<li>Meter readings</li>\n<li>Payments</li>\n<li>Debts and disconnections</li></ul>\n\n<blockquote>I switched to these morons in January and despite umpteen phone calls and an official complaint, i have still not received an electricity bill in 7 months. Excuse after excuse. More apologies each time i call but still nothing gets resolved. Managers wont speak to me and internal departments are always engaged, The whole thing has been a total shambles and it's not over yet. <b>-Robert Parks, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"customer-service\">Customer service</h2>\n\n<p>With customer service making up 62% of all complaints, it’s no wonder that many of EON’s negative Trustpilot reviews are concerning their customer service. If you’re contacting customer service, it’s likely that you’re having issues with your energy already. So, when the person on the other end of the phone is less helpful than you like, it can make the situation even more stressful than it needs to be.</p>\n\n<blockquote>On the phone to E. ON for three hours,getting cut off twice. Still no answers to the questions I raised. I will be changing suppliers as soon as I can, because of my experience. <b>-Carey Laws, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<p>However, many other customers praise EON’s customer service, especially when it comes to smart meters. Even some who were cautious of getting a smart meter have been reassured by the customer service team and are kept well informed throughout the process.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Very friendly staff who explained clearly what needed to be done. Job completed quickly and with no mess left behind. <b>-GL, Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<p>In March 2021, EON (like many other suppliers) was ordered by Ofgem to pay compensation to around 28,000 customers who switched to EON between 2013 and 2020. A total of £238,000 will be paid out by EON, with customers receiving an average of £8.49 each. Across 18 different energy providers, over 1 million households were overcharged when they switched during this period.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact\">Contacting EON</h2>\n\n<p>We tested out all the different ways you can contact EON to find out which is the quickest and how long you should expect to be waiting to talk to someone.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at the table below to see what we found.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Response time</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email </td>\n        <td>8 hours 40 minutes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone </td>\n        <td>16 minutes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr> \n        <td>Live chat </td>\n        <td>1 minute </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Social media</td>\n        <td> 10 minutes</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>EON had fairly long wait times, but nothing too unexpected when it comes to one of the Big Six. We found that the best time to call was at 9am, as soon as the lines open, but the other methods have pretty similar wait times throughout the day.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../contact/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Contact EON</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"worth-it\">Is it worth the money?</h2>\n\n<p>As well as being a 100% renewable energy provider, EON is one of the more competitively priced members of the Big Six, offering a range of different tariffs and deals for those with electric vehicles, smart meters, and solar panels.</p>\n\n<p>In the 2020 Which? Satisfaction Survey, EON received just 2/5 for value for money - the same as British Gas.</p>\n\n<p>To make sure you’re not paying too much for your energy, give Utility Switchboard a call on…</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"btn-phone btn-pink\">020 3992 7717</a></center>\n\n<p>EON came under fire in December 2020 when 1.6 million customers were charged early, or even twice, for their energy due to a technical fault. Most of the affected direct debits were taken out on 24th December rather than in January, when they were due. EON has paid out over £55,000 in goodwill payments to those affected. If you were affected financially, you can still claim compensation if you contact EON.</p>\n\n<blockquote>EON failed to conduct the appropriate checks to ensure that this did not lead to any unintended consequences for customers. <b>-Ofgem</b></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"app\">EON app review</h2>\n\n<p>The EON app is very simple and has all the essential features of an energy management app. Customers can use their EON online account details to sign in to the app and give meter readings, view their energy usage, make payments, and more.</p>\n\n<p>iOS users have given the app 3.2/5. Since 2018, there has been a steady flow of reviews mentioning slow loading times and features crashing or not working. Despite this, the app is praised for its easy navigation and design.</p>\n\n<blockquote>I recently switched to eON, the app looked decent- a nice animation when opening it and nice graphics showing the status of my switch. But that’s it. I tried to submit my opening meter readings when asked, I tried several times but always get a message that’s says “there’s a problem, contact customer services below”. So I clicked on “contact us”, submitted a message then guess what? I got another error saying “there’s a problem”. <b>-Grengreb, The App Store</b></blockquote>\n\n<p>Android users have given the EON app 1.8/5. Once again, slow loading times are a recurring theme in the Google Play reviews. However, if there are features that don’t work, Android users are often redirected to the EON website to continue through their online account.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Absolutely useless! When it actually loads and doesn't leave you hanging on the front screen, passwords are not accepted (as others have stated, and yes, we can log in outside the app... Like you say, it's you, not us). If you are lucky enough log in no information is available, links do not work and chat is always unavailable. <b>-Becki W, Google Play</b></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"eon-next\">EON Next reviews</h2>\n\n<p>EON Next is a new branch of the EON group, offering 100% renewable energy and focusing on a greener, more sustainable future.</p>\n\n<center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rRaoiIl5y1E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" loading=\"lazy\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></center>\n\n<p>Npower customers and new EON customers will get quotes for and be placed on EON Next tariffs, meaning that EON Next is essentially EON reinventing itself.</p>\n\n<p>EON Next has its own Trustpilot page where it proves more impressive and customer-friendly than the EON page. Achieving a rating of 4.3/5 compared to EON’s 3.5/5, a lot of the positive reviews here contradict other EON reviews, praising the customer service and knowledgeable staff.</p>\n\n<blockquote>E.ON is been the best company i have in years. I used to be with a different company and E.ON is best by far. Always keeping me update with prices and telling you when you contract expires, which this days is very handy. And the best thing everything is online, so zero stress. I will recommend E.ON to all my family and friends. <b>-Mr Reyes, EON Next Trustpilot</b></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"verdict\">Our verdict</h2>\n\n<p>Despite many unflattering customer service reviews and their apps not quite up to scratch, EON is really turning itself around, making improvements year on year.</p>\n\n<p>EON stands out from the crowd when it comes to its renewable energy tariffs and has proven an improvement to many ex-Npower customers. EON Next has definitely improved EON’s image and we can’t wait to see what’s to come!</p>\n\n<p>Taking into account reviews from customers, knowledgeable energy experts, and our own experiences, Utility Switchboard is giving EON <b>4/5</b>.</p>"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityProviderStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/eon/contact","category":"contact"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/eon/warm-home-discount","category":"warm-home-discount"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/providers/eon/review","provider":"Eon"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
