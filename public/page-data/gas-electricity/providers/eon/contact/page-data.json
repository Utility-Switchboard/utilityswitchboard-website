There is more than one EON customer service number to choose from, but how do you know which is best for your query? We’ve put together a helpful guide to speak to the right person when you contact EON. </b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meter-reading\">Giving a meter reading</h2>\n\n<p>Sending a meter reading is something you should do every month to ensure you’re paying the right amount for your energy. Without a reading, you’ll get an estimated bill, which may mean your bill will be higher than usual if you’re not using as much energy as they’re estimating.</p>\n\n<p>There are several different ways to contact EON to avoid this:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Through your online account</li>\n<li><a href=\"#app\">Via the app</a></li>\n<li>Over the phone</li>\n<li>Have a smart meter send meter readings over automatically</li></ul>\n\n[gas_electricity_smart_meter_cta]\n\n<p>If you prefer giving your readings to a human on the other end of the phone, you can still contact EON on 0345 052 0000.</p>\n\n<p>The EON app is also a great way to submit your meter readings and is available on Google Play and the App Store.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"smart-meter\">My Eon smart meter isn’t working</h2>\n\n<p>Not being able to use the smart features of your smart meter can be a pain, especially when it comes to sending Eon meter readings. If your smart meter isn’t working, there are a number of things that could be wrong with it and a lot of ways to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>If your in-home display is blank, it could simply be that the batteries have run out. They don’t have a very long battery life, so it’s probably best to keep it plugged in at all times – it barely uses any energy either!</p>\n\n<p>If you have an older smart meter and have switched providers recently, it could be that your smart meter isn’t compatible with your new provider’s technology. This would result in your smart meter reverting to ‘dumb mode’ and losing its smart features. Smart meters reverting to dumb mode is a common problem for which a solution is in the works as we speak. So, you can either wait for the update or ask EON for a new meter.</p>\n\n<p>If neither of these are the problem, you should contact EON by calling 0345 052 0000 or by using the live chat feature on their website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-key-card\">Getting a new top-up key/card</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve all put something down and forgotten where we’ve left it, whether that’s your phone, your glasses, your gas card or your electricity key. And I’m sure a lot of us have had them break on us too. But EON has made it super simple to get a new one.</p>\n\n<p>The first step is to fill out <a href=\"https://www.eonenergy.com/for-your-home/your-account/prepayment/lost-card-or-key\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this form</a> with your name and address, if you need a gas card or an electricity key, what’s wrong with your current card or key, and whether there’s any credit on it that needs recovering.</p>\n\n<p>EON will then try and contact you within 15 minutes Monday-Friday 8am-8pm or Saturday 8am-6pm. Or you can call 0345 301 5955 outside those times.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bill-query\">Making a payment or topping up</h2>\n\n<p>EON has a range of different tariffs with different payment options available. If you’re on a direct debit, you don’t have to worry so much about your bills, as it’s taken automatically each month. But how can you make a payment on your prepaid or pay as you go tariff?</p>\n\n<p>The easiest way to pay your bill is through your EON online account or the app, which you can find on Google Play and the App Store.\nBut we know that sometimes that can’t be done, so there are a few numbers you can call about this.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a gas card or electricity key, you’ll have to top these up in a shop which offers PayPal or Payzone. If you can’t get to a shop, EON offers £5 emergency credit which you can use when you’ve got less than £2 gas or £1 electricity left on your meter.</p>\n\n<p>To make a different payment call: 0345 052 0000<br>\nTo talk about prepayment meters call: 0345 303 3040</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-house\">Moving into a new house</h2>\n\n<p>Moving house can be a stressful time where you have all kinds of different things to do before you can relax. Sorting out your gas and electricity is one of the easiest, especially when we can do most of the research and leg work for you.</p>\n\n<p>When you move into your new home, make sure you contact your old provider to cancel your contract, giving them your final meter reading. Then, get in contact with the current property’s supplier with the opening meter reading. Finally, sign up to a new tariff in your new home! We’re happy to help you through these steps to make the process quick and easy.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_moving_house_cta]\n\n    <h3>Can I stay with EON when I move?</h3>\n\n    <p>Yes, you can! To help them make the switch, you’ll have to provide EON with:</p>\n    \n    <ul><li>Your account number</li>\n    <li>The address you’re leaving</li>\n    <li>Your new address</li>\n    <li>The date you’re moving</li>\n    <li>Your closing meter readings</li></ul>\n\n    <p>If you were already supplied with EON and are bringing them to your new home, call 0345 303 3020 or fill out the ‘Moving Home’ form on their website. However, if you’re moving to a different area, your rates might change slightly depending on where you are.</p>    \n    \n    <p>You can also take advantage of their live chat feature or fill in a contact form.</p>\n    \n    <h3 id=\"switch\">I want to switch provider or tariff in my new home</h3>\n\n    <p>That’s great news!
