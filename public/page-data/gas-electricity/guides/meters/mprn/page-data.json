However, an MPRN number is an important one for your gas meter.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-mprn\">What is an MPRN?</h2>\n\n<p>A Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN) is a sequence of 10 numbers that are unique to your address. Your energy provider can use this number to identify your gas supply point and make sure that they’re supplying the right property. Your MPRN is registered to your house, so even if you switch suppliers or have a new meter fitted, it will stay the same.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mpan-msn\">What’s the difference between MPRN, MPAN, and MSN?</h2>\n\n<p>An MPRN and an MPAN are almost the same. They are both numbers which help your provider identify your energy supply, however, a <a href=\"../mpan/\"><b>Meter Point Administration Number (MPAN)</b></a> is for your electricity supply. An MPAN is a lot longer than the 10 digit MPRN.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"../msn/\"><b>Meter Serial Number (MSN)</b></a> refers to the physical meter on your property. It is used for both electricity and gas meters and will change if your meter changes. It’s not used often – mostly when you don’t know your MPRN or MPAN.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-mprn\">Why do I need an MPRN?</h2>\n\n<p>An MPRN helps your energy provider find your address and make sure they’re taking over the right gas supply. You won’t need it often, however, you might need it if:</p>\n\n<ul><li>You’re moving house</li>\n<li>You’re switching providers</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you move house, your Meter Point Reference Number will be different, however, if you’re just switching providers it will stay the same. It will also stay the same if you get a new meter or upgrade to a smart meter.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"find-mprn\">Where can I find my MPRN?</h2>\n\n<p>Your MPRN should be printed on your gas or dual fuel bill – usually on the first or second page. It will be 10 numbers long with no letters and unique to your home. Look for a row of numbers starting with an M (for Meter Point Serial Number).</p>\n\n<p>EXAMPLE:</p>\n\n<p><b>M 1807080003</b></p>\n\n<p>If your MPRN starts with a number between 74 and 77, this indicates that you’re supplied by an independent gas transporter. Independent gas transporters usually charge more as it’s a privately owned network.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve switched providers and don’t have a bill yet, there’s no need to worry. When you switch providers, your MPRN doesn’t change so it will be the same on both your new and old bills. If you’ve just moved house, you should ask your landlord or the previous owner what your MPRN is. They should be able to tell you as they will have recently used it to submit their final meter readings.</p>\n\n<p>Some newer gas meters might also have your MPRN stamped onto your meter, but it won’t be on every meter.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_serial_numbers_cta]\n\n    <h3>How do I find my MPRN number without a bill?</h3>\n\n        <p>If you can’t find your Meter Point Reference Number, you can call your current gas supplier or call the Meter Point Reference Number Helpline on 0870 608 1524. You can also use Find My Supplier using your address to find out your supplier or MPRN.</p>        \n        \n        <p>Alternatively, you might be able to use your meter serial number (MSN) which you can find on your meter.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you have the wrong MPRN on your bill, this might mean that there has been a mix up between different house’s gas supply. This might be because your meter details are wrong on the national database, your meter is supplied by two different gas companies, or someone has given a wrong number somewhere.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If this has happened, you may end up paying for someone else’s gas usage, or you might be switched suppliers by mistake. If this happens, you should call your provider and make sure it’s changed to the right one.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you’ve been switched due to a wrong MPRN, you need to tell your old and new providers that there has been a mistake. Your old and new providers will fix the problem between themselves. It can take up to 12 weeks to sort this out, however, you’ll still pay your old provider for your energy usage as if nothing has happened.</p>        \n        \n        <p>If you’re happy to stick with the new provider, you should still call them and let them know. This just makes sure they don’t switch you back when they find out about the error.</p>"}},"navigation":{"internal":{"content":"{\"What is an MPRN?\":\"#what-is-mprn\",\"Difference between serial numbers\":\"#mpan-msn\",\"Why do I need an MPRN?\":\"#why-mprn\",\"How do I find my MPRN?\":\"#find-mprn\"}"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityGuideStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/prepayment-credit","title":"Prepayment Meters vs Credit Meters and Tariffs - Which one’s right for me?"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/topping-up-payg","title":"How do you top up a prepayment meter?"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/meter-readings","title":"How and why to submit meter readings to your energy provider"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/meter-types","title":"Types of residential energy meters in the UK"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/smart-meters","title":"Everything you need to know about smart meters"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/mprn","category":"meters"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
