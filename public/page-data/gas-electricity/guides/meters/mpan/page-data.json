Knowing your MPAN is useful to help the switch go as smoothly as possible.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-mpan\">What is an MPAN?</h2>\n\n<p>A Meter Point Administration Number (MPAN) is a 21 digit number which is unique to your electricity supply point and is used by energy providers to identify your property. It’s sometimes referred to as your supply number as it identifies your supply point. Because your MPAN is tied to your property, it won’t change when you switch providers or change your meter (except with an Economy 7 meter).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mprn-msn\">What’s the difference between an MPAN, MPRN, and MSN?</h2>\n\n<p>An MPAN and an <a href=\"../mprn/\"><b>MPRN (Meter Point Reference Number)</b></a> are essentially the same things – they both identify your energy supply point. However, an MPAN is only for electricity and an MPRN is only for gas.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"../msn/\"><b>Meter Serial Number (MSN)</b></a> is a similar number which identifies your meter. You’ll have one for your electricity meter and one for your gas. However, an MSN only identifies your meter rather than location and will change if your meter changes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-mpan\">Why do I need an MPAN?</h2>\n\n<p>You won’t need to use your MPAN often, however, it’s good to know for when you do need it. It’s most commonly used when:</p>\n\n<ul><li>You’re switching supplier</li>\n<li>You’re moving house</li></ul>\n\n<p>The MPAN helps your new energy provider make sure they’re taking over the supply for the right house. If you don’t know the MPAN in your new home, get in contact with the current supplier and they’ll be able to tell you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"find-mpan\">Where can I find my MPAN?</h2>\n\n[gas_electricity_serial_numbers_cta]\n\n<p>Because your MPAN refers to your electricity supply rather than your meter, you won’t find it printed on the meter like you would an MSN.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, you’ll find your MPAN on your electricity bill. It’s usually in the corner on the first page and will be a box dividing a set of numbers. Look out for something like this:</p>\n\n<h3>What do the numbers mean?</h3>\n<p>It may look confusing, but you’ll normally only be asked for the bottom 13 numbers when talking to your supplier. However, it’s useful to know what each number represents.</p>\n\n<p>The top row made up of 8 numbers is often called the <b>‘supplementary data’</b>. It gives you the characteristics of your supply and is the responsibility of the supplier.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"jumbo-ol\"><li>The first number is the <b>Profile Class</b> and shows the type of meter you have installed.</li>\n\n<p>It could be any number between 01 and 08, but MPANS for your home will be either 01 or 02. Most meters will come under the 01 category, however, Economy 7 meters will be 02. Profile classes 03 to 08 identify non-domestic and business meters.\n</p>\n\n<li>The next number will be the <b>Meter Timeswitch Code</b>.</li>\n\n<p>This helps your provider identify the metering equipment in finer detail - whether it’s a credit meter, prepayment, or smart meter and how many meter readings or dials there are. It could be any number between 000 and 999.</p>\n\n<li>The final number on that row is the <b>Line Loss Factor</b>, which represents how much the supplier will have to pay the distribution company.</li>\n\n<p>The Line Loss Factor shows two things: the amount of electricity lost through cables and the amount of infrastructure used to supply the property.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom row is called the <b>‘core’</b>. This is the most important part of the MPAN as this is the line you’ll be asked for by your provider. This 13-number sequence is completely unique to you and your electricity supply.</p>\n\n<li>It starts with the <b>Distributor ID</b>. </li>\n\n<p>This will be a number between 10 and 28 indicating the Distribution Network Operator and region you’re in. Codes 10 to 23 are the main regional operators and 24 to 28 are independents that operate in a specialist format.</p>\n\n<li>The next two boxes create an 8 digit <b>Meter Point ID Number</b>.</li>\n\n<p>This is an identification code for your meter and is completely unique to your property. It could be any sequence of numbers but there will be 4 digits in one box and 4 in the next. Some suppliers keep these 8 digits together in the same box but it will still be split into two 4-digit numbers.</p>\n\n<li> The final 3 numbers are a validation to make sure all of the numbers are correct. It’s calculated by:</li></ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiply the first digit by 3</li>\n<li>Multiply the second digit by the next prime number</li>\n<li>Repeat for each digit</li>\n<li>Add up the products</li>\n<li>The check digit and the sum should be the same</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>How do I find my MPAN number without a bill?</h3>\n<p>If you need your MPAN, but don't have a bill to hand, you can call your supplier, who will be able to tell you your MPAN number. If you don’t know who your supplier is, you can visit the <a href=\"https://www.energynetworks.org/operating-the-networks/whos-my-network-operator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Energy Networks Association</a> where you can find out your <b><a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/distribution/whos-my-dno/\">Distribution Network Operator (DNO)</a></b> and how to get in touch. Your DNO should be able to tell you your MPAN.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Alternatively, you might be able to use your meter serial number (MSN). This will be printed on the front of your meter and identifies each individual meter. However, if you have a new meter or smart meter fitted, your MSN will be different with each meter, unlike an MPAN which will stay the same.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"more-than-one\">Why do I have more than one MPAN number?</h2>\n\n<p>It’s not uncommon for a household to have two MPANs. This normally happens if your property is supplied by two different electricity meters or your electricity meter is supplied by two different meter point administration numbers. These are known as ‘related MPANs’.</p>\n\n<p>Related MPANs were set up to read electric heating separately from other electricity use. This allowed people to pay a different rate for each and cuts out the need for a fusebox when it comes to heating your home.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you have more than one MPAN number, you’ll likely have a harder time switching energy providers. If you do find a provider willing to help you switch, they might be able to offer you a new meter or switch one of them off to make it easier for you in the future.</p>"}},"navigation":{"internal":{"content":"{\"What is an MPAN?\":\"#what-is-mpan\",\"Difference between serial numbers\":\"#mprn-msn\",\"Why do I need an MPAN?\":\"#why-mpan\",\"How do I find my MPAN?\":\"#find-mpan\",\"I have more than one MPAN\":\"#more-than-one\"}"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityGuideStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/prepayment-credit","title":"Prepayment Meters vs Credit Meters and Tariffs - Which one’s right for me?"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/topping-up-payg","title":"How do you top up a prepayment meter?"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/meter-readings","title":"How and why to submit meter readings to your energy provider"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/meter-types","title":"Types of residential energy meters in the UK"}},{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/smart-meters","title":"Everything you need to know about smart meters"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/meters/mpan","category":"meters"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
