But what is the Warm Home Discount and how much could you claim from your energy provider?</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-whd\">What is the Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n<p>The Warm Home Discount is a Government-led scheme aimed to tackle fuel poverty over the winter months. It was set up in 2011 and was due to come to an end in March 2021, however, due to the important support it provides, it has been extended.</p>\n\n<p>The scheme is opt-in for energy providers who can then offer eligible customers a one-off payment of £140 to put towards their electricity bills between October and March.</p>\n\n<p>The discount is paid directly into your electricity account as credit or as a voucher if you have a prepayment meter.</p>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<h2 id=\"eligibility\">Eligibility criteria</h2>\n\n<p>There are two groups of people who are eligible for the Warm Home Discount. These groups are known as the ‘core’ and ‘broader’ groups.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-eligibility\">The core group</h3>\n\n<p>You’ll qualify for the core group if:</p>\n<ul><li>Your energy supplier is part of the Warm Home Discount scheme</li>\n<li>Your name (or your partner’s name) is on the electricity bill</li>\n<li>You or your partner are getting the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit</li></ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"broader-eligibility\">The broader group</h3>\n\n<p>Different providers have slightly different criteria for the broader group, however, you should qualify for the broader group if:</p>\n<ul><li>Your energy supplier is part of the Warm Home Discount scheme (and offers it to the broader group)</li>\n<li>You’re on a low income</li>\n<li>You receive certain means-tested benefits</li></ul>\n\n<p>Which benefits you have to receive in order to be eligible for the discount depends on the criteria of your energy provider. In many cases, you have to meet certain criteria as well as sub-criteria.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"#providers\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">See the criteria for your provider</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"apply\">How to apply for the Warm Home Discount</h2>\n\n<p>How you apply for the Warm Home Discount scheme depends on how you qualify for the discount.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standard-container\">\n    <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n        <a href=\"#apply-core\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt1\">\n            <span>\n            <i class=\"fas fa-hands\"></i>\n            <h3>Core group</h3>\n            </span>\n            This means that you automatically receive the Warm Home Discount.\n        </a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col50 xy-center\">\n        <a href=\"#apply-broader\" class=\"whd-elig-group opt2\">\n            <span>\n            <i class=\"fas fa-clipboard-list\"></i>\n            <h3>Broader group</h3>\n            </span>\n            This means that you you'll need to apply to receive the Warm Home Discount.\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"apply-core\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount in the core group</h3>\n\n<p>If you qualify for the core group, you shouldn’t have to do anything to receive the discount.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll receive a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) between October and December. This letter will tell you that you qualify for the Warm Home Discount and you should receive your £140 automatically by the end of March.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure to read the letter as you may have to send some extra details in order to receive your discount. Your letter might tell you to call the Warm Home Discount helpline (0800 731 0214) to give these details, which you’ll need to do before 28th February.</p>\n\n<p>If you think you qualify for the core group and haven’t received a letter by 31st December, you should call the Warm Home Discount helpline on 0800 731 0214.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"apply-broader\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount in the broader group</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group, you’ll have to apply directly through your provider.</p>\n\n<p>Each provider only has a limited number of discounts they can give out so it’s important that you check with them as early as possible to see if you’re eligible and how to apply. They choose who gets the discount, however, it’s usually on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\n\n<p>The application window opens around October and can close at any time if your provider runs out of discounts so it’s best to apply sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in a park home and pay your electricity directly to the site owner, you can use the link below to apply. Alternatively, you can call 0330 555 9424.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.parkhomeswhd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply for the Warm Home Discount in a park home</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"providers\">Which providers offer the Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n<p>The Warm Home Discount is an opt-in scheme, so not all providers offer it. However, providers with over 200,000 customers have to offer the discount to those who receive the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit (known as the ‘core group’). Providers with over 250,000 customers have to also offer the discount to those who meet certain income-related criteria (known as the ‘broader group’).</p>\n\n<p>Use the table below to see if your

bill.</p>\n\n<p>This will be paid directly into your electricity account where you can use it as credit to put towards your bill. If you have a prepayment meter, you’ll receive a £140 voucher to use instead. Your provider will tell you how to put this credit onto your meter.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a dual fuel account with your provider, you might be able to have the £140 put towards your gas bill instead of electricity. This might be more helpful if your heating is gas-powered.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-its-paid\">When is the Warm Home Discount paid?</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re accepted into the Warm Home Discount scheme, your provider will apply the discount to your bill by 31st March.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the core group and haven’t received your discount by then, it may be that the DWP don’t have enough information on who your electricity provider is. If this is the case, it should say in your letter. To fix this, all you have to do is call the Warm Home Discount helpline on 0800 731 0214.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group and haven’t received your discount, you should contact your energy supplier to see what’s happened. If you’ve switched suppliers since October, you may not receive your discount from your new provider if:</p>\n<ul><li>They don’t support the scheme</li>\n<li>They only support the scheme for the core group</li>\n<li>You don’t meet their criteria</li>\n<li>You haven’t applied with your new provider</li>\n<li>You applied for the Warm Home Discount too late</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"switch\">What happens to my Warm Home Discount if I switch providers?</h2>\n\n<p>If you switch providers once you’ve been approved for the Warm Home Discount scheme, you may miss out on your £140.</p>\n\n<p>Customers in the core group will still get their discount if they switch providers, even if the new provider doesn’t offer the scheme. If you’re in this group, all you have to do to make sure you still get your discount is call the Warm Home Discount helpline on 0800 731 0214 and tell them that you’ve switched providers. They’ll likely ask for your Warm Home Discount reference number (which you’ll find on your letter from the DWP) and your MPAN (which you’ll find on your electricity bill).</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in the broader group, you’ll likely miss out on the Warm Home Discount when you switch, even if you’ve been accepted by your current provider. You’ll have to reapply for the discount with your new provider, however, you’re not guaranteed to be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll miss out if:</p>\n<ul><li>Your new provider doesn’t offer the discount</li>\n<li>You don’t meet your new provider’s broader group criteria</li>\n<li>Your provider has run out of discounts to give</li>\n<li>You switch outside of the application window</li></ul>\n\n<p>Bear in mind that if you do switch, you might be able to save more than £140, even by switching to a provider that doesn’t offer the Warm Home Discount. To make sure you’re on the best deal for you, give Utility Switchboard a call on...</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"tel:+442039927717\" class=\"btn-phone btn-pink\">020 3992 7717</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"winter-fuel\">Will the Warm Home Discount affect my Winter Fuel Payment?</h2>\n\n<p>Any Winter Fuel Payments you receive won’t be affected by your Warm Home Discount.
