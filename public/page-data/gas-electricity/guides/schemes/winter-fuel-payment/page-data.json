You should receive a letter telling you how much you’re getting and an estimated payment date.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t been paid by 31st March, you should contact the Winter Fuel Payment team on 0800 731 0160 from the UK or +44 (0)191 218 7777.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whd\">Will the Winter Fuel Payment affect my Warm Home Discount?</h2>\n\n[gas_electricity_warm_home_discount_cta]\n\n<p>Your Warm Home Discount won’t be affected by your Winter Fuel Payment. If you qualify for both, you should definitely take advantage of this as you could receive up to £440 to cover your winter energy bills.</p>\n\n<p>If you receive the Guarantee Credit element of your Pension Credit, you’ll get this automatically, as long as your energy provider supports the scheme. Some of the Winter Fuel Payment eligibility criteria is very similar to that of the Warm Home Discount so it’s likely you will qualify for both schemes. However, you might qualify for one but not the other.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"../warm-home-discount/\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\">Find out more about the Warm Home Discount</a></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"cwp\">Will the Winter Fuel Payment affect my Cold Weather Payment?</h2>\n\n<p>Your Winter Fuel Payment won’t affect any Cold Weather Payments you receive.
