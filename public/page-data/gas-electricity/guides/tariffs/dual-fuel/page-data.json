It’s often easier and less hassle, but will it save you money? Is it the right deal for you? Find out with our handy guide to dual energy tariffs.</b></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is\">What is dual fuel?</h2>\n\n<p>‘Dual fuel’ means that both your gas and electricity come from the same provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re choosing to have the same provider for gas and electricity, you’ll often opt for a dual fuel tariff. This is where both fuels are included in the same tariff as well as being from the same provider. </p>\n\n<p>It’s generally more convenient than using separate providers for each, and can be cheaper too! Many providers offer a discount for those signing up both fuels together, however, this isn’t guaranteed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"am-i-on-dual\">How do you know if you’re on a dual energy tariff?</h2>\n\n<p>There is no physical difference between dual fuel and single fuel energy tariffs - the gas and electricity that powers your home will be the same. The main difference is how you pay your bills.</p>\n\n<p>If you pay your gas and electricity bills to separate providers, you’re definitely not on a dual fuel tariff. Dual fuel tariffs are only available if both bills are paid to the same provider.</p>\n\n<p>If your bills are paid to the same provider, you’re probably on a dual fuel tariff. Most providers will combine your two energy bills into one, however, some might send you two separate bills: one for gas and one for electricity.</p>\n\n<p>If you only have one fuel type supplied to your property, you won’t be on a dual fuel tariff. Dual fuel tariffs are only available to properties with both gas and electricity supplies.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest way to find out if you’re on a dual or single fuel tariff is to look at the tariff details on your bill or through your online account. It will tell you whether or not your tariff is dual fuel as well as how much you’re paying for your gas and/or electricity.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can contact your supplier and they can help you out.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-single\">Dual vs single fuel tariffs - which is best?</h2>\n\n<p>Because dual fuel tariffs aren’t necessarily the cheapest anymore, which tariff is best depends entirely on your personal circumstances and energy usage. </p>\n\n<h3>Benefits of dual fuel tariffs</h3>\n\n<p>Millions of households across the UK have opted for a dual fuel tariff, and many will tell you that it takes the hassle out of energy management.
