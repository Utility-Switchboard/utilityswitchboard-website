It’s important that they keep up a strong, reliable supply, especially as they operate lines in some of the larges cities in the country.</p>\n\n<p>As a DNO, they’re different from your energy provider in that they’re responsible for the distribution of electricity across the country, while your provider is responsible for supplying it to your home.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rkcp8nckeo70/21vB9oDtDTaFurFBKM9Ucm/38635af771734e35613c339d919a2afe/dno-map-sp-energy-networks.jpg\" alt=\"DNO map SP Energy Networks\" class=\"inner-content-img\">\n\n<h2 id=\"power\">Where does SP Energy Networks power?</h2>\n\n<p>SP Energy Networks operates in three of the UK’s largest cities (Liverpool, Glasgow, and Edinburgh) which accounts for 1.6 million customers, as well as significant rural areas such as North Wales, Scottish Borders, and Dumfries & Galloway.</p>\n\n<p>SP Energy Networks is working towards installing millions more electric vehicle charging points across their network, installing over 500,000 in Liverpool alone to meet the UK’s aim towards carbon net zero by 2040.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"help\">What can SP Energy Networks help you with?</h2>\n\n<p>As SP Energy Networks is responsible for the power lines and cables, they can help you out with several different electricity-related problems, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Connecting you to the network</li>\n<li>Moving your electricity meter</li>\n<li>Giving support and resolving power cuts</li>\n<li>Safety advice</li>\n<li>Finding out your MPAN</li>\n<li>Finding out your electricity supplier</li>\n<li>Fixing faulty streetlights and equipment</li>\n<li>Upgrading power connections</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"connection\">How to get connected</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to make a connection to the SP Energy network, for example, if you’re planning on installing an electric vehicle charger or a heat pump at home or simply moving your energy meter, the first thing you’ll need to do is make an enquiry about your connection.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this by calling 0845 270 0785 from Scotland or 0845 270 0783 from England and Wales. You can also email gettingconnected@scottishpower.com.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve done this, you can then apply for your new connection.
