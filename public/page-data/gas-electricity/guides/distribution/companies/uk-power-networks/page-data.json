They distribute over 76,500GWh to over 19 million homes and businesses - 29% of the population.</p>\n\n<p>They are working hard towards the Government’s plan for <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/environment/net-zero/\"><b>net zero</b></a> and aim to install charging points for over 3.6 million electric vehicles across their region by 2030 to help reach that goal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"help\">What can UK Power Networks help you with?</h2>\n\n<p>UK Power Networks can help everyone across London, the South, and South East of England with any issues or questions related to your electricity supply.</p> \n    \n<p>You should turn to UK Power Networks for:</p>\n<ul><li>Help to find your MPAN</li>\n    <li>Finding out your electricity supplier</li>\n    <li>Moving, connecting, and disconnecting electricity supplies</li>\n    <li>Reporting power cuts</li>\n    <li>Receiving support and updates on power cuts</li>\n    <li>Safety advice</li>\n    <li>Tree trimming around power lines</li>\n    <li>Reporting damage to power lines and cables</li>\n    <li>Shrouding</li>\n</ul>    \n\n<h2 id=\"connection\">How to get connected</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re looking to set up a new electricity connection, the first thing you need to do is check that UK Power Networks is your Distribution Network Operator. To do that, you can use this <a href=\"https://www.energynetworks.org/operating-the-networks/whos-my-network-operator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DNO finder</a> or compare your MPAN to the table using our <a href=\"/gas-electricity/guides/distribution/whos-my-dno/\"><b>‘Who’s My DNO?’</b></a> guide.</p>\n\n<p>Then, you can start applying for your connection. You’ll have to fill out a few simple questions <a href=\"https://www.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/electricity/new-connection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> before you can start applying. This can point you in the right direction and give you an idea of who to talk to depending on what type of connection you’re trying to set up.</p>\n\n<p>To apply for your connection, UK Power Networks will need:</p>\n<ul><li>The location of the work</li>\n<li>Your contact details</li>\n<li>A short description of what you’re planning to do and when you need it done by</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can apply either by calling 0800 029 4280 or online using the link below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/electricity/new-connection/apply\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Apply online</a></center>\n\n<p>Once you’ve submitted your application, UK Power Networks will contact you to find out a bit more about your connection. They’ll give you a quote and walk you through how the process works and what to do next.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/electricity/new-connection/time-and-cost\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Check the timescale and cost of your project</a></center>\n\n<p>Before the installation date, a trench will need to be dug in order to reach and lay your electricity cables. You can have UK Power Networks do this for you or you can do it yourself. You’ll also need to have a new meter box installed outside to connect your power supply and have your energy provider come out to install your meter on the same day that your supply is connected.</p>\n\n<p>On your installation day, UK Power Networks will do some more digging to the closest underground power cable to your property. This will likely be in the road or pavement outside so you might have to pre-warn your neighbours (UK Power Networks will deal with the council).</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about the connection process, you can call 0800 029 4280 or email myconnection@ukpowernetworks.co.uk</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"power-cut\">What to do in a power cut</h2>\n\n<div class=\"inner-box-info question\">\n    <div class=\"inner-box-info-icon question\"></div> <span><h3>Did you know...</h3> <p>Your energy supplier isn’t responsible for dealing with power cuts or anything electrical or gas-related other than the billing of your usage.

You can do this by calling the dedicated power cut line 105 or by using the power cut reporter below.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/power-cut\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">Report a power cut</a></center>\n\n<p>If your power cut has already been reported, both of these methods will be able to give you updates on the situation and an estimated time for your power to be back on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"priority-services\">Join the Priority Services Register</h2>\n\n<p>If you or someone in your household needs a little extra support during a power cut, you can apply for the Priority Services Register. </p>\n\n<ul><li>You can apply for it either through your energy supplier or your DNO if you:</li>\n<li>Rely on medical equipment</li>\n<li>Have refrigerated medicines</li>\n<li>Have a serious or chronic illness</li>\n<li>Are over 60</li>\n<li>Have a disability</li>\n<li>Have children under 5 years old living with you</li>\n<li>Have mental health issues</li>\n<li>Have temporary difficulties due to pregnancy, bereavement, are recovering from hospital treatment etc</li></ul>\n\n<p>When you’re on the register, you’ll be given a huge amount of support, including home visits, warnings about power cuts in your area and possible outages due to the weather, and more.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact\">Contact UK Power Networks</h2>\n\n<p>If you ever need to contact UK Power Networks, you can do so using the numbers and links below.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Method</th>\n        <th>Number/link</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone (connections)</td>\n        <td>0800 029 4280</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Phone (general)</td>\n        <td>0800 029 4285</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email (connections</td>\n        <td><a href=\"mailto:myconnection@ukpowernetworks.co.uk\">myconnection@ukpowernetworks.co.uk</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Email (general)</td>\n        <td><a href=\"mailto:care@ukpowernetworks.co.uk\">care@ukpowernetworks.co.uk</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Facebook</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ukpowernetworks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Twitter</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ukpowernetworks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@UKPowerNetworks</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>WhatsApp</td>\n        <td><a href=\"https://t.co/E3neixcGDH?amp=1\">Click here to be redirected</a></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/distribution/companies/uk-power-networks"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
