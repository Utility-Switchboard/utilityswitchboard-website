All you need is your postcode and the Energy Networks Association will be able to tell you who your DNO is.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"idno\">Independent Distribution Network Operators (IDNOs)</h2>\n\n<p>IDNOs develop, operate, and maintain local electricity distribution networks alongside the DNOs. They are either directly or indirectly (through another IDNO) connected to the DNO’s network.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of different IDNOs working across the country:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Eclipse Power Ltd</li>\n<li>Energy Assets Network Ltd</li>\n<li>Last Mile Electricity</li>\n<li>ESP Electricity Ltd</li>\n<li>Fulcrum Electricity Assets Ltd</li>\n<li>Harlaxton Energy Networks Ltd</li>\n<li>Independent Power Networks Ltd</li>\n<li>Leep Electricity Network Ltd</li>\n<li>Murphy Power Distribution Ltd</li>\n<li>The Electricity Network Company Ltd</li>\n<li>UK Power Distribution Ltd</li>\n<li>Utility Assets Ltd</li>\n<li>Vattenfall Network Ltd</li></ul>\n\n<p>You’re likely on with an IDNO if you live in a new-build estate, but you can find out using <a href=\"http://www.energynetworks.org/info/faqs/who-is-my-network-operator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this tool</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>What’s the difference between an IDNO and a DNO?</h3>\n\n<p>An IDNO is very similar to a DNO, but they operate in much smaller areas. They’re often an extension for the existing DNO network where new developments are being built, for example, new housing estates and commercial development sites.</p>\n\n<p>DNOs and IDNOs are both regulated to the same standards by Ofgem, however, they have different licenses and conditions to meet. The license conditions of IDNOs mean that customers connected to their networks will be entitled to the same level of service and guaranteed performance standards of DNOs.</p>\n\n<h3>What are the benefits of IDNOs?</h3>\n\n<p>Ofgem licenses IDNOs to increase competition in the energy distribution market and keep bills low for the consumers. IDNO and DNO prices are capped as it is a very monopolised market.</p>\n\n<p>Your IDNO can:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Make grid applications for you</li>\n<li>Reduce the cost of your contestable connection work</li>\n<li>Offer asset value payments</li>\n<li>Provide a more collaborative service</li>\n<li>Liaise and resolve issues with the DNO or National Grid for you</li>\n<li>Get your connection faster</li>\n<li>Design, build and adapt the connection to your development</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"gas\">Is there a DNO for gas?</h2>\n\n<p>The DNOs for gas are more commonly known as Gas Distribution Companies (GDC) or gas transporters, however, they do the same job as a DNO.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll most likely need to get in touch with your Gas Distribution Company when you:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Report a leak</li>\n<li>Smell gas</li>\n<li>Get connected to the gas mains</li>\n<li>Have your gas meter or pipes moved</li>\n<li>Have your outside gas meter box installed or replaced</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"gdc\">Who’s my GDC?</h2>\n\n<p>There are 4 distribution companies which operate across the UK.

You can also call to report any damage to power lines and substations which might put people in danger.</p>     \n     \n<p>If you’re in Northern Ireland, you should call 03457 643643 or in the Republic of Ireland call 1850 372 999.</p>     \n     \n<p>Most DNOs also have a live power cut tool that lets you find updates and check the status of any power cut in your area.

Even if you’re not feeling unwell, you should call a doctor to be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>\n\n<p>If you are feeling unwell after a suspected leak, <b>call 999</b> as soon as you start feeling ill.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"home-energy\">DNOs and home energy systems</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re connecting solar panels or wind turbines to the grid, you have to inform your DNO. This shouldn’t be too difficult, however, the process will vary depending on the size of your system.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re installing smaller systems (up to 3.7kW) you have to inform your DNO within 28 days. Because you won’t be adding a significant load to the grid, the regulation is very simple for small systems.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/Resource%20library/G98%20forms.zip\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">I'm installing a small energy system</a></center>\n            \n<p>If your system is over 3.7kW, your installer will need to get permission from the DNO before they install the system. This will require a network study to ensure that the local grid is adequate for your power supply and whether or not extra arrangements need to be made. You might be charged for this study and your DNO will send you a quote for the cost of any additional work needed to connect your system to the grid.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/Resource%20library/G99.zip\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">I'm installing a larger energy system</a></center>\n\n<p>If you’re connecting a charging point for your electric vehicle, the DNO will have to assess and approve your installation. It should be straightforward, however, there are cases where you might have to have fuse and cable updates or unloop your power supply if you are connected via a neighbour. The DNO will organise for these changes to be made before installation.</p>\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/Resource%20library/EV%20HP%20Application%20Form%20v9.6.docx\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"curve-btn-main btn-white\" rel=\"noopener\">I'm installing an EV charger</a></center>"}},"navigation":{"internal":{"content":"{\"What is a DNO?\":\"#what-is-dno\",\"Who is your DNO?\":\"#my-dno\",\"Indendent DNOs\":\"#idno\",\"Is there a DNO for gas?\":\"#gas\",\"Who's your GDC?\":\"#gdc\",\"How to report a power cut\":\"#power-cut\",\"How to report a gas leak\":\"#gas-leak\",\"DNOs & home energy systems\":\"#home-energy\"}"}}},"allContentfulGasElectricityGuideStandardPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/distribution/power-cut","title":"Do you know what to do in a power cut?"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gas-electricity/guides/distribution/whos-my-dno","category":"distribution"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
